Gauge theories from scattering amplitudes with minimal assumptions,"We revisit the emergence of a Yang-Mills symmetry in theories with massless spin 1 particles from fundamental physical properties of scattering amplitudes. In the standard proofs, some symmetry and reality properties of the coupling constants in three-point amplitudes are assumed. These properties cannot be justified using only three-point amplitudes but we show that they arise as consequences of the consistent factorization of four-particle amplitudes, for particular choices of the particle basis. This applies to self-interactions of massless spin 1 particles and also to their interactions with spin 0 and 1/2 particles. CP invariance is a derived property, not an additional assumption. The situation for gravity interactions is analogous and it is dealt with in the same fashion.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21664v1,human
"Updated bounds on the (1,2) neutrino oscillation parameters after first JUNO results","Within the standard $3ν$ framework, we discuss updated bounds on the leading oscillation parameters related to the $(ν_1,\,ν_2)$ states, namely, the squared mass difference $δm^2=m^2_2-m^2_1$ and the mixing parameter $\sin^2θ_{12}$. A previous global analysis of 2024 oscillation data estimated $δm^2$ and $\sin^2θ_{12}$ with fractional $1σ$ errors of about $2.3\%$ and $4.5\%$, respectively. First we update the analysis by applying the latest SNO+ constraints, that slightly shift the $(δm^2,\,\sin^2θ_{12})$ best fits. Then we apply the constraints placed by the first JUNO results, that significantly reduce the uncertainties of both parameters. Our updated global bounds (as of 2025) can be summarized as: $δm^2/10^{-5}{\rm eV}^2 = 7.48\pm 0.10$ and $\sin^2θ_{12}=0.3085\pm0.0073$ (with correlation $ρ=-0.20$), corresponding to $1σ$ uncertainties as small as $1.3\%$ and $2.4\%$, respectively. We also comment on minor physical and statistical effects that, in the future, may contribute to lift the current mass-ordering degeneracy of $(δm^2,\,θ_{12})$ estimates.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21650v1,human
Cosmological Probes of Lepton Parity Freeze-in Dark Matter: $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ & Gravitational Waves,"In the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, a residual symmetry known as lepton parity: $(-1)^L$, remains preserved. Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $σ$ allows for the coupling $N S σ$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow Sσ$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}<T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $σ-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langleσ\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $σ-h$ coupling is small, then $σ$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($σ\rightarrow Sν$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21634v1,human
Freeze-in at Low Reheating and Direct Detection of Fermion Dark Matter,"We investigate a low-reheating-temperature freeze-in scenario within a minimal model of fermionic dark matter interacting through a pseudoscalar mediator. In this setup, dark matter is produced via the decay of the pseudoscalar, which remains in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model bath. We derive the thermalization and non-thermalization conditions for the new fields and obtain the corresponding direct-detection constraints and projections on the model based on LZ and DARWIN experiments, respectively.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21520v1,human
Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves,"We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488v1,human
Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences,"The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $Ω_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21362v1,human
Effective LFV couplings at the electron-proton collider,"We estimate the accuracy with which the coefficient of the lepton flavour-violating dimension-six operators can be measured at the proposed electron-proton collider. Cuts-based analysis is performed to compute the signal significance at the centre of mass energy of 1.3 TeV, with a total integrated luminosity upto $\sim$ab$^{-1}$. Using the optimal observables method for the kinematic distributions, we study the sensitivity of the effective couplings. We also study the impact of the initial electron beam polarisation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21326v1,human
Exploring muonphilic dark matter with the $Z_2$-even mediator at muon colliders,"The Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE) remains a compelling but enigmatic signal from the inner region of our galaxy. Muonphilic dark matter (DM), which couples exclusively to muons via a new mediator, provides a viable explanation for the GCE and relic density while naturally evading constraints from direct detection, collider searches and other multi-messenger observations. Based on the viable non-resonant parameter space identified in previous global fits, we perform a comprehensive study exploring the prospects for discovering such muonphilic DM in the context of a future $3$ TeV muon collider, focusing on simplified models with a $Z_2$-even mediator. Three distinct search strategies are investigated: visible on-shell mediator decays ($μ^{+}μ^{-}γ$ final state), invisible on-shell mediator decays (mono-photon plus missing energy), and mono-photon production via off-shell mediators. Through a detailed signal-background analysis using cut-and-count methods, we project the exclusion limits at $95\%$ confidence level for seven representative models across a wide range of mediator masses. Our results demonstrate that the projected limits cover a significant portion of the viable parameter space that explains the GCE, establishing a muon collider as a decisive machine for testing the muonphilic DM hypothesis.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21290v1,human
Neutral Magnetic Monopole in the Standard Model,"The standard model has the electroweak monopole which has the magnetic charge $4π/e$, as a hybrid between the Dirac and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole"") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4π/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21174v1,human
Deuteron yields near the QCD phase transition,"We investigate the influence of QCD phase transition and critical fluctuations of the critical end point (CEP) on the deuteron yield within the functional renormalization group (fRG) approach, by using the nucleon coalescence model and a low energy effective field theory of quarks and mesons. It is found that the two-point baryon density correlation function is enhanced in a narrow region radiated from the CEP along the phase boundary. The deuteron yield arising from the two-point baryon correlation is small compared to the leading-order contribution, which is attributed to the fact that in the regime of low collision energy, i.e., the region of large baryon chemical potential, the freeze-out curves deviate from the critical region, resulting in that the enhancement of the deuteron yield stemming from the critical fluctuations near the CEP is mild.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21117v1,human
Exotic-interaction searches on small scales via near-threshold enhancement,"Exotic interactions between fermions mediated by new bosons beyond the Standard Model may hold the key to several fundamental conundrums on the frontier of physics.However, laboratory searching for exotic interactions on small length scales is fundamentally held back by the short force range.Here we propose that the force range of exotic interactions tends to infinity when the oscillation frequency of exotic interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, i.e., the new bosons become nearly on-shell. This is named as the near-threshold enhancement. Through the near-threshold enhancement, even fermions at distances larger than the original force range can make considerable contributions to exotic interactions. Therefore, the size of the experimental apparatus can break the limitation of the force range, and thus both the signal of exotic interactions and the sensitivity of sensors can be greatly enhanced. We also propose a method to search for the exotic interactions in the mass range between 80 $μ$eV and 800 $μ$eV taking advantage of the near-threshold enhancement. For the coupling $g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}$, we expect an improvement on its upper bounds of 10 orders of magnitude at 800 $μ$eV. This method can be further extended to enhance the search for other types of exotic interactions and boost the study of new physics beyond the Standard Model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21073v1,human
Caustic crossings in giant arcs with extended dark matter objects,"Caustic-crossing stars observed in giant arcs behind galaxy clusters provide a powerful probe of dark matter substructure. While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20761v1,human
The Intrinsic Dimension of Collider Events and Model-Independent Searches in 100 Dimensions,"The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20760v1,human
A simple generalization of the low-energy theorem for the effective Higgs-gluon-gluon coupling for the case of simultaneous decoupling of several heavy quarks,We extend in an extremely simple and straightforward way the well-known low-energy theorem for an effective Higgs-like scalar-gluon-gluon coupling [1] (as well as a similar one for for the effective coupling of the Higgs-like field to the light scalar quark currents) in QCD including arbitrary number of heavy quarks in addition to the light ones. The application of the generalized low-energy theorem allows the extraction of the four-loop effective Higgs-gluon-gluon coupling valid for extensions of the Standard Model with additional heavy quarks from the 3-loop results of [2] for the decoupling constant of $α_s$.,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20622v1,human
CP Violation in Charmed Meson Decays into Final States with $η'$,"We derive Standard Model predictions for the CP asymmetries of singly-Cabibbo suppressed $D\rightarrow Pη'$ decays, where $P=K,π,η$. Our predictions are based on the approximate SU(3)$_F$ symmetry of QCD and include first-order symmetry-breaking effects in a systematic way. The underlying symmetry leads to correlations between different decay modes. To this end we predict the correlations between $ a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^+\to π^+ η')$ and $a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D_s^+ \to K^+ η')$ as well as $a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^0\to π^0 η')$ and $ a_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}(D^0\to ηη')$. Our results can be used to probe the Standard Model with future measurements by LHCb, Belle II and BESIII. At the same time, such future measurements permit the extraction of the key theory parameter related to the ratio of color-suppressed to color-favoured contributions to the decay amplitudes. Future data on both branching ratios and CP asymmetries will automatically improve our predictions and thereby also their sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20585v1,human
Natural inflation in Palatini $F(R)$,"$F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials. In this study, we examine natural inflation and show that its consistency with observational data can be restored when the model is embedded within $F(R)$ Palatini gravity, specifically for $F(R) = R + αR^n$ with $7/4 \lesssim n \leq 2$. For completeness, we also demonstrate that models with $n > 2$ do not yield comparable improvements, achieving partial agreement with the data only in the limit $n \rightarrow 2$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20557v1,human
The effect of sound speed on the gravitational wave spectrum of first order phase transitions in the early universe,"Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions are a promising probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, as many extensions of the standard model result in first-order phase transitions in the early universe, from which the resulting gravitational waves could be detectable with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).   The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $α_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\text{wall}$, transition rate $β$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,φ)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.   In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,φ)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20436v1,human
$B^+\to K^+ ν\barν$ Excess and DM semi-annihilation,"In 2023, Belle II collaboration announced the observarion of the $B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν$ decay channel for the first time. This decay channel provides a clean signal with high precision in theoretical calculation. However, we encounter $2.8σ$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. To resolve this excess, we study scalar dark matter (DM) model with local discrete $Z_3$ symmetry. Assuming dark $U(1)_X \equiv U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ symmetry, this $U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken into local discrete $Z_3$ by non-zero vacuum expectation value of dark Higgs boson. Considering dark Higgs mass is $2$GeV, we can explain the recent ${\rm Br} (B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν)$ excess reported from Belle II collaboration and relic abundance at the same time.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20430v1,human
Anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES with Skyrme pseudopotential,"Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387v1,human
Towards the two-loop electroweak corrections to the Drell-Yan process: the infrared structure,"We discuss the lepton-pair production process in Quantum Electrodynamics. We present the ultraviolet-renormalised and infrared-subtracted finite contribution of the second-order virtual corrections to the inclusive lepton-pair production cross section $u\bar u\to e^+e^-$. The results are obtained within a new computational framework, OCEANN, developed in view of the evaluation of the exact two-loop electroweak virtual corrections to high-energy scattering processes. One of the key methodological features in this approach is the representation of the scattering amplitude with arbitrary precision at every stage of the calculation. The analysis in QED allows us to address the treatment of the infrared structure of the process and it can be easily extended to the complete electroweak Standard Model case. The perfect agreement with the literature, for this subset of corrections, provides a non trivial validation of the general framework.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20365v1,human
Revisiting lepton flavor violation: $τ$ and meson decays,"The minimal type-I seesaw model provides a simple explanation of neutrino flavor oscillations and induces charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV). Despite extensive previous studies, semileptonic cLFV channels remain underexplored. Using updated form factors, decay constants, and oscillation data, we revisit $τ$ and meson decay channels, performing a systematic comparison across the seesaw parameter space. Surprisingly, we find that decays such as $τ\to \ellρ$ can dominate over purely leptonic $τ$-sector probes, including $τ\to 3\ell$ and even $τ\to\ell\,γ$, in certain regions. In contrast, heavy-meson decays remain far below experimental sensitivity. Considering global constraints on the seesaw parameters, we derive branching ratios for the relevant cLFV processes and identify those within potential reach of next-generation experiments.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20320v1,human
First determination of fragmentation functions in an exotic-hadron candidate,"In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \ll M_s \sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20217v1,human
Multiplicity dependence of quarkonia production at ultra high energies,"In this paper we propose an approach in high energy QCD, which allows us to calculate the inclusive quarkonia production at ultra high energies. This approach is based on $t$-channel unitarity and on the expressions for dipole densities from the procedure of summing of large Pomeron loops which we have developed in our previous papers. In the framework of this approach we discuss the dependence of quarkonia production on the multiplicity of the accompanying hadrons. In this paper we used the three gluons fusion mechanism for quarkonia production, without assuming the multiplicity dependence of the saturation scale. We found the multiplicity distribution of produced gluon with ( $ \mathcal{P}^{J/Ψ}_n$) and without ($\mathcal{P}^{gluon}_n$) the quarkonia production. It turns out that $ \frac{\mathcal{P}^{J/Ψ}_n}{\mathcal{P}^{gluon}_n} \propto n^2 $ as has been expected and discussed in corresponding publications.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20079v1,human

Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model,"We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20715v1,human
Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity,"We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19802v1,human
"Strangelet Searches from Neutron Stars, Binary Mergers, and Gamma-Ray Bursts with Current and Future Observatories","Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star. Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $γ$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $γ$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19799v1,human

This event revolutionized our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation. In this proceeding of the 2025 International Congress of Basic Science, we describe how it transformed our view of cosmic acceleration (dark energy).

Naive $T$-odd Drell-Yan angular coefficients as a probe of the dimension-8 SMEFT,"We propose the ``naive"" $T$-odd Collins-Soper moments in the Drell-Yan process as probes of previously unexplored directions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parameter space. We show that the moments $A_6$ and $A_7$ in the high invariant mass and transverse momentum region are sensitive to dimension-8 $CP$-odd semi-leptonic four-fermion operators with an additional gluon field strength tensor. Using the projected integrated luminosity of a future high-luminosity LHC, we show that effective ultraviolet scales in the few-TeV range can be probed with this process.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19617v1,human
Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation,"In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $α^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610v1,human
"Viability of $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ Flavour Symmetries in Light of the First JUNO Result","We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $θ_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2θ_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3σ$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19408v1,human
Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass,"We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($χ$), a doublet fermion ($Ψ$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($φ_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $φ_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_μ$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386v1,human
Limits on GeV-scale WIMP Annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidals with IceCube DeepCore,"Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\leq 300 \, \mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\left<σv\right>$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\% confidence level are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-22} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-20} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19385v1,human
Lepton flavor violation in Higgs boson decays at the HL-LHC,"We investigate the prospects for discovering lepton flavor-violating Higgs decays in proton-proton collisions, focusing on $h \to \ell_i\ell_j$ ($\ell_i\neq \ell_j, \ell=e,\,μ,\,τ$). The analysis is carried out within a Froggatt-Nielsen model, which provides a natural mechanism for such processes. By scanning the phenomenologically viable parameter space, we identify scenarios that yield observable signals at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). For an integrated luminosity of $2400~\text{fb}^{-1}$, we project that $h \to eμ$ could reach the $5σ$ discovery threshold, while $h \to τμ$ may achieve about $4σ$. We also obtain $2σ$ exclusion limits of $\mathcal{BR}(h \to eμ) \lesssim 4.3 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\mathcal{BR}(h \to τμ) \lesssim 5.2 \times 10^{-5}$. These findings underscore the HL-LHC's unique sensitivity to probe new physics through rare Higgs decays.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19337v1,human
Nonlinear causality and stability of perfect spin hydrodynamics and its nonperturbative character,"Four formulations of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-1/2 particles, distinguished by their treatment of spin (classical vs. quantum) and by the underlying particle statistics (Boltzmann vs. Fermi-Dirac), are analyzed and shown to satisfy the requirements of a divergence-type theory. Moreover, for all the formulations, we define the generating functions associated with the relevant thermodynamic currents and demonstrate that the constructed hydrodynamic theory is nonlinearly causal and stable. The latter is achieved by employing the exact expressions for the distribution functions, indicating a nonperturbative character of our approach.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19295v1,human
Magnetic susceptibility of hot hadronic medium and quark degrees of freedom near the QCD cross-over point,"We argue that the lattice QCD results for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the medium below the cross-over temperature are difficult to reconcile with the available hadronic models. In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19255v1,human
Three-loop banana integrals with three equal masses,We obtain and solve the canonical differential equations for the three-loop banana integrals in dimensional regularisation when three of the four masses are equal. The K3 surface associated with the maximal cuts factorises into a product of two elliptic curves. This allows us to express the differential forms in the canonical differential equations in terms of meromorphic modular forms. We present a rigorous proof that these differential forms only have simple poles and that they define independent cohomology classes. We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature.,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19245v1,human
"SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families","We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210v1,human
Phase structure of 2+1-flavor QCD from an Einstein-dilaton-flavor holographic model,"We construct a holographic QCD model based on the Einstein--dilaton--flavor framework with 2+1 flavors and investigate its phase structure using machine-learning techniques. At zero chemical potential, the model reproduces the equation of state and chiral transition in quantitative agreement with lattice QCD results. By varying the light and strange quark masses, we map out the quark-mass dependence of the transition order and obtain the corresponding phase diagram, which is consistent with phase structures extracted from lattice simulations and other nonperturbative approaches. In particular, the predicted first-order region is found to be small, in line with the most recent lattice QCD analyses. We also examine the critical behavior along the second-order boundaries and the tricritical region, finding that the critical exponents exhibit mean-field scaling characteristic of classical holographic constructions. Integrating machine learning with holographic QCD significantly enhances the efficiency of parameter optimization, providing a robust and practical strategy for improving the predictive power of holographic modeling of QCD thermodynamics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19127v1,human
Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase,"In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19073v1,human

We present the predictions for the corresponding cross sections and spin correlations at NLO electroweak precision, and find that the NLO electroweak contributions are numerically small for the observables considered. Additionally, we use the spin correlations obtained in this paper to analyze the quantum entanglement in the $τ^+τ^-$ system of the $γγ\to τ^+τ^-$ process. Our results show that there is a genuine entangled configuration near the $τ^+τ^-$ invariant mass threshold. This work is helpful for studying the $τ$-pair production induced by photon-photon collision at high energy colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18935v1,human

I describe how the NJL model is treated to imitate the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement QCD properties. The consistency for the parton distribution functions and electromagnetic form factors, as internal structure observables, in comparison with existing data and other theoretical predictions, is also shown. The implications of mimicking the QCD properties in the NJL model for hadron structure observables, as well as the relevance of the results to EIC, EicC, and COMPASS/AMBER future experiments, are discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18904v1,human
"QCD sum rule predictions on gluonic tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{+-},0^{--}$ and $1^{\pm \pm}$","In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the mass spectrum for tetraquark hybrid states, focusing on the $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ color configuration, within the framework of QCD sum rules. As an extension of our previous work on $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ states, we now construct 18 distinct interpolating currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$, $0^{--}$, and $1^{\pm\pm}$. Using operator product expansion (OPE) techniques and including nonperturbative contributions up to dimension six, we obtain key results: for the $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$ states, the predicted masses lie in the range of $7.2-7.3$ GeV, while the $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$ states have slightly lower masses, between 6.9 and 7.1 GeV. These predictions provide strong support for the possible existence of an $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ component within the di-$J/ψ$ structure reported by LHCb. Moreover, our analogous calculations for tetrabottom hybrid states yield mass ranges of $19.4-19.5$ GeV (for $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$) and $19.2-19.3$ GeV (for $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$), offering crucial references for future searches.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18807v1,human
Higgs Production Classifier using Weak Supervision,"A reliable determination of the Higgs production mechanism in hadron collider experiments is essential in the program of the measurements of the Higgs couplings. We employ weak supervision, CWoLa in particular, to train deep neural networks using real data of the diphoton events, in the hope of reducing biases resulting from Monte Carlo simulations. Models based on the convolutional neural network and the transformer are tested and compared. In particular, the classification performance gets slightly better when the photon information is removed from training on the low-luminosity region of $H \to γγ$. We explicitly show that the performance can be improved when the training dataset is enlarged by data augmentation using physics-motivated methods. We further demonstrate that the trained model can be successfully applied to the $H \to ZZ$ and $H \to Zγ$ events, showing that such classifiers are agnostic to Higgs decay modes provided they do not involve strong QCD corrections.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18726v1,human
Probing CP-violating Higgs-Gauge couplings with Higgsstrahlung at $e^-e^+$ collider,"We investigate the sensitivity of a future high-luminosity $e^-e^+$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s}=250~\text{GeV}$ to CP-violating and CP-conserving anomalous $hVV$ interactions via the Higgsstrahlung process. The effects of new physics are parameterized in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory~(SMEFT) framework through six dimension-6 operators modifying the $hVV$ vertices. Using polarized beams and exploiting polarization and spin correlation asymmetries reconstructed from Higgs decay products, we perform a comprehensive analysis across the three dominant decay modes, $h\to b\bar{b}$, $WW^\star$, and $ZZ^\star$. The $h\to WW^\star$ channel exhibits the highest sensitivity to $\mathcal{O}_{HW}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{W}}$, while the $b\bar{b}$ mode constrains the remaining operators with high statistical precision. Sensitivity studies incorporating luminosity scaling and systematic uncertainties show that the projected bounds improve significantly with increasing integrated luminosity, but saturate once experimental systematics exceed the few-percent level. These results highlight the crucial role of spin-based observables and beam polarization in achieving sub-percent precision on SMEFT coefficients at future lepton colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18541v1,human
"KNO scaling, memorylessness and maximal entanglement at universal fixed point","We analyze the experimental data of $\mathtt{p}\mathtt{-}\mathtt{p}$ collisions by the ATLAS and confront it with the AGK model developed by two of the authors, the Kharzeev-Levin~(KL) model and the simple exponential behavior for the Koba, Nielsen and Olesen~(KNO) scaling function. We show that all three models virtually coincide with all available experimental curves crossed at value $z=n/\langle n \rangle$ of the KNO scaling parameter in the broad range of the center-of-mass energies. The theoretical results and the experimental data show that the KNO violating terms are highly suppressed in the vicinity of $z=2$. The special status of the universal scaling point $z=2$, where the KNO scaling is restored for $\mathtt{p}\mathtt{-}\mathtt{p}$ collisions, suggests that it originates from statistical saturation of the optical theorem.   We claim that any unitary model that approximates memoryless distribution in the high energy limit must have the same KNO scaling function $e^{-z}$ in the vicinity of $z=2$ with KNO violating corrections of the order of one over average multiplicity squared. This reflects the maximal entanglement of the final states.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18446v1,human
Curvature Perturbations from Higgs Modulated Reheating,"In this work we investigate curvature perturbations and non-Gaussianity arising from Higgs modulated reheating in the early Universe. We employ three different methods -- the period-averaging (PA) method, the exact method, and the non-perturbative $δN$ formalism -- to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum of curvature perturbations. Our results show that the non-perturbative $δN$ method provides a reliable estimate across a wide range of reheating time and Higgs field values, including regimes where the Higgs field oscillates significantly after inflation. We find that a smaller Higgs self-coupling ($λ$) leads to a larger curvature perturbation, with the non-Gaussianity predominantly taking a local shape. This highlights the importance of considering non-perturbative effects in calculating the curvature perturbation during Higgs modulated reheating, especially for smaller values of $λ$. Our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of reheating and the generation of primordial perturbations in the early Universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18340v1,human
Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD,"Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310v1,human
Entropy and DIS structure functions,"Entanglement entropy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) from the DIS structure functions has emerged as a novel tool for probing observable quantities. The method proposed by Kharzeev-Levin to determine entanglement entropy in DIS from parton distribution functions (PDFs) improves on the momentum-space approach proposed by Lappi et al.[Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf84}, 84 (2024)] and future developed by Boroun and Ha [Phys. Rev. D {\bf109}, 094037 (2024)] using Laplace transform techniques. The entropy of charged hadrons is obtained from the parameterization of the proton structure function and compared with H1 data and HSS and HERA PDFs. Our results for the entanglement entropy align very well with the H1 data across a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$. Finally, the behavior of the entanglement entropy is described at fixed $\sqrt{s}$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$ which indicates that the polarization of the exchanged photon for entropy determination is transverse   at this specific kinematic point.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18285v1,human
Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations,"Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova"" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $ε$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the mass of 0.3 MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $ε\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint is close to the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122v1,human
Topological diagrams of doubly charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit,"The doubly charmed baryon was first observed by LHCb via the non-leptonic decay $Ξ_{cc}^{++}\to Λ^+_cK^-π^+π^+$ in 2017. Subsequently, ongoing efforts have been made to identify other doubly charmed baryons. However, there is no systematic analysis of the topological decomposition for non-leptonic decays of doubly charmed baryons. In this work, we study the topological amplitudes of doubly charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. Tree- and penguin-induced topological diagrams for the $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to \mathcal{B}_c M$ and $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to \mathcal{B} D$ decays are presented. The linear relations between the topological amplitudes and the $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes are derived through tensor contraction and $SU(3)$ decomposition. The magnitude pattern of the topological diagrams is analyzed in the rescattering dynamics and the large $N_c$ expansion. In addition, some amplitude relations are derived to test the Körner-Pati-Woo theorem in the isospin limit.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18068v1,human
Decay matrix of B-\bar{B} mixing: Mixing of dimension-seven operators into dimension-six operators under renormalization,"The precise measurement of the width difference ΔΓ_s among the mass eigenstates of the B_s-\bar{B}_s system requires the calculation of the corresponding decay matrix to order α_s/m_b. QCD corrections to power-suppressed terms in the Heavy Quark Expansion involve the renormalization of dimension-7 four-quark operators for which no general methodology is available yet. In the \overline{MS} scheme one-loop corrections to matrix elements of dimension-7 operators violate the power counting, but we find the responsible terms to be infrared-finite and show that they can be absorbed into finite counterterms proportional to dimension-6 operators. We calculate all these counterterms and subsequently verify the consistency of our results with hadronic matrix elements calculated in the limit of a large number N_c of colours. The condition of correct power counting implies constraints on the possible definitions of evanescent operators.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17759v1,human
Collinear spin correlations of final-state radiation in dense QCD matter,"Spin correlations are required to reproduce the correct azimuthal dependence of matrix elements for successive branchings at disparate angles in QCD jets. In this paper, we study modifications to this, $\cos(2ψ_{12})$, azimuthal pattern in the presence of a quark-gluon plasma. To that end, we consider a simplified setup in which a narrow and energetic QCD antenna is formed inside a medium of fixed length and radiates a collinear emission outside it. The calculation includes both light and heavy-quarks. Further, we do not include medium-induced spin-flip interactions since they are energy suppressed in our formalism. We show that the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the presence of a medium is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum baseline, with its magnitude depending on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. For a medium with a momentum space anisotropy, we find that the azimuthal modulation acquires a phase shift, i.e., $\cos(2ψ_{12}) \to \cos(2ψ_{12}+φ_{\rm med })$, where $φ_{\rm med}$ is a process-dependent function that again depends on the medium properties and splitting kinematics.

Parameter Inference from Final-State Entanglement in Higgs Decays,"The decay out-states of unstable Standard Model (SM) particles provide a unique, well-defined intrinsic quantum-information probe of the SM parameter space. We use Higgs decays as a test case: after tracing out kinematics, we compute entanglement among final-state spins and colors across all decay channels and impose a near-maximal entanglement-entropy criterion. This criterion yields quantitative indications for fundamental parameters. Within the SM, the entanglement entropy exhibits a global maximum close to the observed Higgs mass and the measured $W$ mass, the latter being equivalent to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. In a two-parameter kappa framework, applying the same criterion points to an SM-like balance between vector and fermion couplings, constraining the ratio of the sector-wide rescalings.

Covariance spectrum of MAXI J1820+070: On the nature of the Comptonizing flow,"We present an analysis of the covariance spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its hard state. For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17285v1,human
Investigation of the Spectator Effect on Light Nuclei Production in Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions at High Baryon Density Region,"The light nuclei yields and yield ratios, as sensitive probes of the QCD phase transition, have been precisely measured at various collision energies.However, due to limited detector acceptance, the full $p_{\rm T}$ integral yield often requires extrapolation of the measured transverse momentum spectra to the unmeasured low-$p_{\rm T}$ region via functional fitting.Simulations with the AMPT-HC transport model and an after-burner coalescence approach indicate a significant low-$p_{\rm T}$ enhancement in peripheral collisions or forward rapidities, primarily originating from spectator nucleons.Consequently, conventional extrapolations tend to underestimate the true light nuclei yields.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17273v1,human

Dark Matter Admixed White Dwarfs: A Single-Fluid Approach,"In this study, we investigate the influence of an admixed fermionic dark matter (DM) component on the equilibrium structure of white dwarfs (WDs), with particular emphasis on the effects of varying the DM particle mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and DM fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$). Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17120v1,human
Formation of primordial black holes through Q-balls,"We study the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from Q-balls that are non-topological solitons in scalar field theories. We develop a formula for calculating the density perturbations from the Q-ball charge distribution. We also re-examine the condition for the PBH formation in the matter-dominated era and show that the previously derived formula for super-horizon density fluctuations can be applied to the sub-horizon density perturbations. As an example, we consider the Q-balls in the case of gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, whose charge distribution was obtained by the lattice simulation. We find that the density perturbations are large enough to produce a significant number of PBHs with mass $10^{-15}\,M_\odot -5\times 10^{-12}\, M_\odot$, which can explain all the dark matter in the universe. In the context of supersymmetry, this mass range corresponds to the SUSY breaking scale $\sim 10^6$ GeV, which is consistent with the SUSY particle masses $\sim 10$ TeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17075v1,human
Charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM' at the LHC,"We discuss charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM'. In our analysis we assume $m_{h''}$ = 95.4 GeV, which corresponds to an enhancement observed by the CMS collaboration in the $γγ$ channel. As discussed recently, the MCPM' is consistent with the CMS enhancement. In this model the $h''$ Higgs boson of this mass decays dominantly into $c \bar c$ jets. The cross section for the associated $h''$ production in $p p \to h'' c \bar c$ is found to be almost as big as that for the Drell-Yan (DY) $c \bar c \to h''$ production, much larger than that for two-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$. Since in the MCPM' the dominant $h''$ decay is into the $c \bar c$ channel we have to deal with the $p p \to c \bar c c \bar c$ process with $c$ and $\bar c$ jets. In addition to the signal processes, we have sizeable single parton scattering (SPS) and double parton scattering (DPS) nonresonant background. In our analysis we include diagrams of gluon-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$ which lead to the $c \bar c c \bar c$ final state. We discuss also the possible role of the reaction $p p \to h'' h''$. Assuming 100\% c and $\bar c$ jet tagging we discuss in detail how to improve the signal-to-background ratio. Our analysis shows promising resonance-like enhancements and relatively large cross sections in the $c \bar c c \bar c$ channel within the MCPM'. The ALICE-3 project would be ideal in the future to perform the experimental studies corresponding to the theoretical studies discussed here.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17026v1,human
Geometry-induced azimuthal anisotropy in coherent $J/ψ$ photoproduction,"Azimuthal anisotropies in heavy-ion collisions are conventionally interpreted as signatures of hydrodynamic flow. We demonstrate that in peripheral collisions, a significant $\cos 2φ$ asymmetry in the decay leptons of coherently photoproduced $J/ψ$ mesons arises purely from the initial-state geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. This modulation originates from the linear polarization of coherent photons, which is radially aligned in impact parameter space and transferred to the vector meson. By employing light-cone perturbation theory within the dipole formalism, we calculate the centrality dependence of this asymmetry for collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Our predictions quantitatively reproduce STAR data. This observable thus provides a rigorous benchmark for distinguishing electromagnetic initial-state effects from collective medium dynamics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17670v1,human
Rescaled Leptonic Unitary Triangles and Rephasing Invariants,"The field of neutrino physics has made significant progress in measuring the strength and frequency of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations in the past two decades. It is clear that the amplitudes involved in the neutrino oscillation probabilities are all phase-reshaping invariants of the quartet forms of the elements of the PMNS mixing matrix. We show in this paper how these quartet observables can be directly linked to the rescaled leptonic unitarity triangles within the framework of three active neutrinos. We provide a systematic discussion of the nine CP-conserving quartets ${\cal R}^{}_{γk} \equiv {\rm Re} \left [ V^{}_{αi} V^{}_{βj} V^{*}_{αj} V^{*}_{βi}\right ] $ along with the universal Jarlskog invariant of CP violation ${\cal J} \equiv \sum_γε^{}_{αβγ} \sum_k ε^{}_{ijk} \; {\rm Im} \left [ V^{}_{αi} V^{}_{βj} V^{*}_{αj} V^{*}_{βi} \right ]$, and place particular emphasis on the matter effect on these quartets. In addition to the well-known Naumov relation for the Jarlskog invariant ${\cal J}$, similar relations connecting ${\cal R}$ in vacuum and its effective counterparts $\widetilde{\cal R}$ in matter are introduced and examined in detail. We find that the effective CP-conserving invariants $\widetilde{\cal R}^{}_{αi}$ in matter can be regarded as linear combinations of their vacuum counterparts. With the latest global fit data of neutrino masses and mixing elements, numerical analyses are carried out to give an intuitive understanding of how these phase-rephasing invariants evolve as the matter density increases.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16942v1,human

Next-to-leading order analysis of $J/ψ+ γ$ production in photon-photon collisions at CEPC,"We systematically investigate the production of $J/ψ+ γ$ in $γγ$ collisions at next-to-leading order in $α_s$ within nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. Calculations for CEPC energy region show the resolved photon contribution is negligible, while the direct photon process dominates, yielding substantial annual $J/ψ$ yields. Significant modifications to $J/ψ$ polarization parameters emerge from color-octet mechanisms, and different NRQCD long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) further yield distinct polarization patterns. Furthermore, the polarization predictions are highly sensitive to the $^3P_J^{[8]}$ LDME, while being insensitive to the $^1S_0^{[8]}$ and $^3S_1^{[8]}$ LDMEs. Leveraging the cleaner environment of $e^+e^-$ collisions versus hadronic processes, the production of $J/ψ$ associated with a photon in $γγ$ collisions provides a high-precision platform to test LDMEs universality and resolve longstanding $J/ψ$ polarization puzzles.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16881v1,human
Competition of $χ_{c}(2P)$ quarkonia and continuum in $e^+ e^- \to e^+ e^- D \bar{D}$,"We discuss the production of $D \bar{D}$ pairs in $e^+ e^-$ collisions, where $D$ refers to either $D^0$ or $D^+$. The continuum mechanism with the $t/u$-channel vector-meson $D^*$ exchanges are considered. The results of the calculation depend on the parameter of the off-shell form-factor for the virtual $D^*$ mesons. The $D^* D γ$ coupling constants are found from the $D^* \to D γ$ decays. We find relatively large contribution for the $D^0 {\bar D}^0$ channel and much smaller contribution in the $D^+ D^-$ channel. In the second case we consider also the $D^{\pm}$ exchanges. We conclude that the bump at $M_{D^0 {\bar D}^0} = 3.8$ GeV observed by the Belle and BaBar Collaborations has rather continuum origin than it corresponds to the broad resonance $χ_{c0}(3860)$. We discuss also production of the $χ_{c2}(3930)$ resonance which is a candidate for the $χ_{c2}(2P)$ state. This state can decay into both $D \bar{D}$ channels, however the branching fractions are not well known at present. From a comparison of our model results to the BaBar data we find $B(χ_{c2}(3930) \to D \bar{D}) = 0.58 \pm 0.13$ using the two-photon width $Γ_{γγ} = 0.544$ keV (obtained for the Buchmüller-Tye potential) evaluated within the light-front approach (NRQCD limit). Our finding of $Γ_{γγ} \times B(χ_{c2}(3930) \to D \bar{D}) = 0.32 \pm 0.07$ keV is close to the Belle and BaBar results. Realistic predictions of the differential distributions in several variables and integrated cross-sections are given for the Belle II kinematics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16862v1,human
In-depth analysis of the clustering of dark matter particles around primordial black holes. Part II. Analytical prescriptions for spikes,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16800v1,human
Radiative Neutrino Mass Generation and Dark Matter through Vector-like Leptons,"This study presents a radiative three-loop framework for neutrino mass generation, employing an asymmetric Yukawa coupling between two new scalar $SU(2)_L$ doublets and vector-like lepton doublets. Dark matter candidates arise from the scalar sector of one of the doublets and play a crucial role in the generation of neutrino masses through their nonzero scalar mixing. The singly charged scalar sector undergoes an analogous mixing structure. A single generation of vector-like leptons yields three nondegenerate neutrino masses as a consequence of the asymmetric Yukawa combinations entering the neutrino mass matrix. The model is tested against dark matter phenomenology, neutrino mass and mixing data, and the charged lepton flavor-violating process $μ\rightarrow e γ$, showing compatibility with current bounds and leading to experimentally accessible predictions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16762v1,human
Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing,"The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16732v1,human
Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension,"A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points.

A new suite of Lund-tree observables to resolve jets,"We introduce a class of collider observables, named Lund-Tree Shapes (LTS), defined from declustering trees originating from the Lund jet plane representation of the QCD radiation pattern in multi-jet scattering processes. At the differential level, they are continuous global variables akin classical event shapes and $n\to n+1$ jet-resolution parameters, which probe the geometry and hierarchical structure of the radiation in an event. At the integrated, cumulative level, they naturally define $n$ jet rates, providing a jet-multiplicity-based characterisation of multi-jet final states. Their definition applies to scattering processes with any number of resolved jets in the final state, as well as to groomed jets. They are thus usable as resolution variables in the context of higher-order calculations via phase-space slicing, matching fixed-order calculations to parton showers, and testing the logarithmic accuracy of shower algorithms. From a theoretical viewpoint, such observables feature a simple all-order structure and are free of non-global logarithmic corrections. As an initial application, we derive next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accurate predictions for processes with two QCD legs at $e e$, $pp$ and $e p$ colliders, and matched predictions to next-to-next-to-leading order for the LHC, discussing aspects of collider phenomenology.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16723v1,human
Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes,"Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16565v1,human

Modular TM$_1$ mixing in light of precision measurement in JUNO,"This paper investigates the landscape of models based on modular $S_4$ symmetry that predicts the trimaximal TM$_1$ mixing pattern for leptonic flavor mixing, and explores their parameter spaces with constraints from the latest high-precision measurement on $θ_{12}$ and $Δm^2_{21}$ given by JUNO experiment. We review on how the mixing pattern arises from residual symmetries after the spontaneous breaking of a flavor symmetry, via an appropriate vacuum alignment of modular fields and flavon fields. We show three different models that realize the TM$_1$ in three approaches with the same symmetry structure. Due to different model building strategies used, predictions on the CP-violating phase and the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay are different, making them distinguishable.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16348v1,human

High-energy physics is a big data science that utilizes large-scale facilities, detectors, high-performance computing, and its worldwide networks.

"Electromagnetic form factors: A window into the $DΛ_c$, $D^*Λ_c$, and $DΛ_c^*$ molecular structure","The internal structure of exotic hadrons remains one of the most compelling puzzles in strong interaction physics. In this work, we provide crucial insights into the nature of doubly-charmed pentaquarks by investigating their electromagnetic properties. Using QCD light-cone sum rules, we present the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic dipole moments of $DΛ_c$, $D^*Λ_c$, and $DΛ_c^*$ molecular pentaquarks with $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$, respectively. Our analysis reveals a striking hierarchy of magnetic moments: $μ_{DΛ_c^*} > μ_{D^*Λ_c} > μ_{DΛ_c}$, driven by distinct quark-level mechanisms. While light quarks dominate the overall response, we find that charm quark contributions become strategically important when light quark contributions partially cancel. Beyond dipole moments, we predict higher multipoles -- electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments -- that fingerprint the spatial deformation of these states, revealing prolate versus oblate charge distributions. These results provide the first systematic predictions for electromagnetic moments of molecular pentaquark configurations, establishing essential benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental studies. The distinctive patterns we uncover will enable quantitative comparisons with alternative structural models, ultimately helping to resolve the nature of doubly-charmed exotic hadrons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16052v1,human
Modified Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing confronted by JUNO $θ_{12}$ measurement,"The JUNO collaboration has released its first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations results, obtaining $\sin^2θ_{12} = 0.3092\pm 0.0087$, an improvement in precision by a factor of 1.6 over previous combined results. We confront the minimally modified tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $θ_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern is one of the most popular simple mixing scheme for neutrinos. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. Minimal modifications preserving one column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, yielding three patterns: a) unchanged third, b) unchanged second and c) unchanged first column. Pattern a) is excluded since it keeps $θ_{13}=0$. Pattern b) predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ and specific CP phase correlations, but JUNO's smaller $|V_{e2}|$ disfavors it at more than 3.5$σ$. Pattern c), predicting $V_{e2} = \cosτ/\sqrt{3}$, can be in agreement with current data within 1$σ$, and implies $\sin^2θ_{12} = (1-3\sin^2θ_{13})/3(1-\sin^2θ_{13})$ and CP violating quantity $\sin θ= \pm 0.998$. The negative sign favors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Upcoming experiments can further test this scenario.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15978v2,human
Structure Formation with Dark Magnetohydrodynamics,"Long-range interactions in the dark sector can give rise to collective plasma phenomena that are capable of modifying the evolution of dark matter halos. We present the first study of gravitational collapse in a secluded dark $U(1)_D$ model using a magnetohydrodynamic description of the dark matter. We show that dark magnetic fields generate an anisotropic pressure that alters the Jeans scale and suppresses small-scale power in a direction-dependent manner. For a range of primordial magnetic spectral indices, this effect produces distinctive modifications to the linear matter power spectrum. We find that current observations cannot yet constrain viable dark magnetic fields, as CMB tensor modes mostly provide more stringent constraints. Nevertheless, forthcoming high-resolution probes of the matter power spectrum (CMB-HD lensing, HERA, and EDGES) will be able to test these predictions and are sensitive to dark charge-to-mass ratios in the range $10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}\lesssim q_χ/m_χ\lesssim 10^{-14}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15810v1,human
How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study,"The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793v1,human
Axiverse Baryogenesis,"The QCD axion may offer a unified origin for the baryon asymmetry and dark matter through axiogenesis. However, in the minimal QCD axion scenario, axiogenesis either underproduces baryons or overproduces dark matter, and the required kinetic misalignment initial conditions are in tension with axion quality. In this \textit{Letter}, we demonstrate that the axiverse naturally resolves these tensions: the QCD axion emerges as a linear combination of multiple axion-like fields, evading the overclosure problem thanks to new dissipation channels , while introducing additional Peccei--Quinn symmetries that ensure a high quality QCD axion. We illustrate these points in a toy model with two axions. This framework predicts a rich phenomenology within experimental reach, including dark matter detection prospects, astrophysical signals, and collider signatures.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15794v1,human
The Heavy Dark Photon Handbook: Cosmological and Astrophysical Bounds,"We investigate cosmological and astrophysical constraints on dark photons with masses $\sim 10^{-1}$-$10^3$ MeV. These dark photons can be copiously produced either in the early universe or during core-collapse supernovae, potentially leaving distinct observational signatures. First, we derive updated constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables that rely on the thermal relic abundance of dark photons, including the CMB spectrum, primordial light element abundances, and galactic/extragalactic gamma-ray flux. We consider the minimal reheating temperature possible, $T_{\rm RH} = 6 \, \rm MeV$, such that our constraints are conservative, but unavoidable within the minimal dark photon model. Then, for supernova-sourced dark photons, we systematically examine all relevant observational bounds, revisit the standard cooling argument and derive limits from other arguments such as fireball formation, low energy supernovae and galactic positron injection.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15785v1,human
Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape,"We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784v1,human
SURFing to the Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging,"Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15779v1,human
Resolving Ratio Redundancy in Chemical Freeze-out Studies with Principal Component Analysis and Bayesian Calibration,"We introduce a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--Bayesian framework for extracting chemical freeze-out conditions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that resolves long-standing ambiguities in hadron-ratio--based analyses. By constructing all possible hadron-yield ratios from a chosen set of species and transforming them into an orthogonal PCA basis, the method removes linear redundancies and eliminates the information loss and systematic uncertainties associated with ratio selection. Energy-wise Bayesian calibration of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is then performed directly in this decorrelated space, with a Gaussian Process emulator enabling fast and accurate model evaluations. A detailed Sobol sensitivity analysis, together with the PCA loading structure, identifies the most informative ratio combinations and reveals a transition from chemical-potential--dominated to temperature-controlled freeze-out with increasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The calibrated model reproduces all measured ratios, and the extracted freeze-out parameters are consistent with previous HRG determinations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15707v1,human

Further Reduction of the PDF Uncertainty in the High-Mass Drell-Yan Spectrum Utilizing Neutral and Charged Current Inputs,"Uncertainties in the parametrization of Parton Distribution Functions are a serious limiting systematic uncertainty in Large Hadron Collider searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics.

The hybrid model outperforms both a state-of-the-art XGBoost model and a purely quantum implementation by a factor of two, achieving an expected 95% CL upper limit on the non-resonant double Higgs boson production cross-section of $1.9\timesσ_{\text{SM}}$ and $2.1\timesσ_{\text{SM}}$ under background normalization uncertainties of 10% and 50%, respectively. In addition, expected constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling $κ_λ$ and quartic vector-boson-Higgs coupling $κ_{2V}$ are found to be improved compared to the classical and purely quantum models.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15672v1,human
Bridging the Gap: Connecting Atomic Nuclei to Their Quantum Foundations,"We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis by employing a factorized nuclear structure model that explicitly accounts for both individual nucleons and correlated nucleon pairs. This novel framework establishes a paradigm that directly links the nuclear physics description of matter (in terms of protons and neutrons) to the particle physics schema (in terms of quarks and gluons). Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. The successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure, as it directly connects nucleon-level and parton-level quantities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15659v1,human
Fantômas: An analysis of parton distributions in a pion with Bézier parametrizations,"We systematically explore the parametrization dependence of the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) to better quantify the true uncertainty from global QCD analyses. To achieve this, we employ a novel technique that automates the generation of polynomial parametrizations for PDFs using Bézier curves. This technique is implemented in a C++ module, named Fantômas, which is now included within the xFitter program. As an example, we examine the charged pion PDF. Our analysis reveals that the sea and gluon distributions in the pion are strongly correlated, and PDF solutions featuring a vanishing gluon and a large quark sea are still experimentally allowed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15657v1,human
New features in the Z2xZ2 3HDM two component DM model,"We investigate the constraints and phenomenology of a three Higgs doublet model (3HDM) with a $\Z2\times\Z2$ symmetry, featuring two inert scalar doublets that give rise to a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario. We analyze the model's vacuum structure, exploring the competition between different symmetry-breaking minima, and subject it to comprehensive theoretical and current experimental constraints. Our analysis reveals previously unexplored regions of parameter space with viable dark matter candidates. Notably, we identify scenarios where both DM particles contribute comparably to the observed relic density, offering distinctive experimental signatures that could guide future searches.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15655v1,human
Assessing (H)EFT theory errors by pitting EoM against Field Redefinitions,"Truncations of effective field theory expansions are technically necessary but inherently intertwined with the redundancies of general field redefinitions. This can be viewed as a juxtaposition of power-counting and theoretical uncertainties, which seek to estimate neglected higher-dimensional interactions through approaches based on community consensus. One can then understand the invariance of physics under field redefinitions as a data-informed validation of different power-counting schemes, or as a means of assigning theoretical errors in comparison with algebraic, equation of motion-based replacements. Such an approach generalises widely accepted procedures for estimating theoretical uncertainties within the SM to non-renormalisable interactions. We perform a case study for a representative example in Higgs Effective Field theory, focusing on universal Higgs properties tensioned against process-dependent sensitivity expectations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15609v1,human
Extracting Mellin moments of double parton distributions from lattice data,"Reconstructing Mellin moments of double parton distributions from calculations on a Euclidean lattice requires taking an integral over a variable that may be regarded as a Ioffe time. The Fourier conjugate of this variable plays the role of a kinematic skewness in the double parton distributions. We discuss the skewness dependence of the relevant hadronic correlation functions. Using several models, we study the impact of this dependence on extracting moments of double parton distributions from existing lattice data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15546v1,human
Towards the full NLO electro-weak corrections to Higgs boson pair production,"Constraining the Higgs boson self-interaction is one of the main goals for the high luminosity phase of the LHC. A promising channel to this aim is the simultaneous production of two Higgs bosons from gluon fusion. For the interpretation of the data, precise theoretical predictions, also for differential cross sections, are needed. Following current projections this requires electroweak corrections at next-to-leading order. We present the contributions of top-Yukawa and Higgs self-interaction-type, as well as the first steps towards inclusion of the complete NLO electroweak corrections.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15267v1,human
Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?,"We derive the flavor fractions $(η^{}_e , η^{}_μ, η^{}_τ)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_μ, f^{}_τ)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $η^{}_μ$ and $η^{}_τ$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $μ$-$τ$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $η^{}_e$ and $η^{}_μ+ η^{}_τ$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_μ$ and $f^{}_τ$ if the $μ$-$τ$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127v2,human
Large-Width New Physics at Colliders: A Gauge-Invariant Resummation Approach,"Broad resonances challenge the standard Monte-Carlo treatment of unstable particles, which introduces a Breit-Wigner width into leading-order matrix elements and can generate unphysical gauge artifacts. We develop a gauge-consistent framework that combines a Dyson-resummed propagator with Slavnov-Taylor-identity-implied resummed vertices, enabling a consistent implementation in MadGraph5. In the Type-I seesaw model, heavy Majorana neutrinos naturally satisfy $Γ\sim m$, leading to strong departures from the Breit-Wigner lineshape, distorted angular correlations, and significant modifications to both $s$- and $t$-channel dynamics. Comparing with the normal and complex-mass schemes, we find that standard treatments can substantially misestimate cross sections and kinematic distributions in the large-width regime. Our results show that existing collider limits on heavy neutrinos-and, more generally, on any broad resonance-should be revisited within a fully resummed framework, opening new opportunities for both experimental searches and theoretical model building.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15114v1,human
Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles,"As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$σ$ of the current central values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111v2,human
Structure of non-global logarithms with Cambridge/Aachen clustering,"We determine the structure of both Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms up to four loops for $e^+ e^-$ processes in perturbative QCD, where final-state jets are defined using the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) clustering algorithm. The calculations are performed within the soft (eikonal) approximation using strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons. The resulting expressions include full colour and complete jet-radius dependence. Compared to the anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ clustering algorithms, the C/A distribution minimises the impact of these non-global logarithms, making it the preferred choice among the three algorithms.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14947v1,human
Sampling Polynomial Rational Remainders with SP$\mathbb{Q}$R: A new Package for Polynomial Division and Elimination,"We introduce SP$\mathbb{Q}$R, a new Mathematica package for the division and elimination of variables from polynomial systems. SP$\mathbb{Q}$R works by sampling and reconstructing results over finite fields, in an analogous manner to many state of the art Integration by Parts algorithms for Feynman integrals. This allows SP$\mathbb{Q}$R to effectively overcome expression swell during the construction of Gröbner bases, which in many cases is the major bottleneck in such computations. Benchmarks on state of the art Macaulay resultants show that SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can deliver substantial gains over symbolic computer algebra workflows -- reducing both runtime and memory footprint by multiple orders of magnitude. Likewise when applied to study Feynman integrals, we show how SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can be used to find previously unknown Landau singularities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14875v1,human
Improved cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions,"We present updated cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions based on state-of-the-art computations of the thermal axion abundance. By combining Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2, we derive improved limits on both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion couplings. Incorporating finite axion mass effects substantially strengthens the bounds for axion masses above 0.1 eV compared to those inferred from the $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ constraint alone. The bounds on the LFC axion-tau coupling and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are improved by several orders of magnitude and the lower bound on the axion decay constant may exceed $10^6$ and $10^8$ GeV, respectively, for axion masses above 1 eV. Our cosmological constraints on LFC axion couplings to muons and taus and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are stronger than all other constraints for masses above 0.3 eV. In particular, they are stronger than recent collider constraints from Belle-II on $τ\rightarrow la$ decays, where $l=e$ or $μ$. The collider constraints on $μ\rightarrow ea$ decays are weaker than the cosmological constraints for axion masses above 100 eV. Our results are relevant for both the QCD axion and axion-like particles (ALPs).",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14864v1,human
511 keV Gamma Ray Echo from Particle Decays in Supernovae,"The formation of a hot and dense core in a core-collapse supernova (SN) can produce massive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles. These particles can decay in the stellar envelope, generating positrons either directly or through secondary processes involving neutrinos or photons. We show for the first time that such positrons regardless of their production channel, can thermalize and annihilate at rest with ambient electrons in the outer SN envelope, producing a characteristic echo of 511 keV gamma rays. For axion-like particles (ALPs), we derive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling ($G_{a γ}$) using Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations of SN 1987A. We also evaluate the sensitivity of upcoming MeV gap gamma-ray telescopes in the 511 keV range, such as COSI and AMEGO, for future Galactic SNe, which can improve existing constraints or enable ALP discovery. The echo signal is a generic prediction for any particle species that efficiently produces positrons near the stellar surface.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14857v1,human
The Penrose Transform and the Kerr-Schild double copy,"There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14854v1,human
Probing Axion via Mössbauer Spectroscopy,"We propose using the ultra-narrow 88 keV Mössbauer transition in $^{109}$Ag to search for QCD axion dark matter. The sub-eV axion field oscillates coherently, inducing a time-varying effective $\barθ_{\rm QCD}$ angle. This, in turn, modulates the nuclear binding energy. From existing linewidth measurements, we derive constraints on the $f_a^{-1}$-$m_a$ plane that already surpass other laboratory bounds. We further detail an experimental setup to directly probe this time-dependent signature via precision Mössbauer spectroscopy in the gravitational potential. This Letter demonstrates that this approach can significantly extend search capability and probe a vast, unexplored region of axion parameter space. Particularly, this setup can probe axion masses beyond the reach of existing experiments, such as atomic-clock measurements, offering a powerful new way for exploring higher-mass axion dark matter. The sensitivity has the potential to be further improved with advancing experimental capabilities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14851v1,human
Lepton flavor violation in photon-induced electron-muon pairs at the HL-LHC,"We show the outstanding potential of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) to discover charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) via the ultra-peripheral process $γγ\to e^\pmμ^\mp$. Using a gauge-invariant Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework -consistent with the most stringent bounds from radiative decays- we perform a full Monte Carlo analysis with multivariate techniques. Our results show that a $5σ$ discovery is achievable with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \gtrsim 2700$ fb$^{-1}$ for favorable benchmark scenarios. This study establishes photon-fusion at the HL-LHC as a powerful probe of cLFV, strongly motivating dedicated searches by the experimental collaborations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14835v1,human
How to pick the best anomaly detector?,"Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14832v1,human
Perturbative aspects of the electroweak phase transition with a complex singlet and implications for gravitational wave predictions,"We present a detailed analysis of strong first-order electroweak phase transitions within the extension of the Standard Model by a complex scalar singlet (cxSM). Focusing on the impact of renormalization scale and gauge dependence, we systematically compare commonly used perturbative frameworks for predicting thermodynamic observables that characterize the phase transition and the associated gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum. These include both the four-dimensional ($4D$) formalism and the dimensionally reduced three-dimensional effective field theory ($3D$ EFT) approach in different renormalization schemes. Within the $3D$ EFT, we compute the effective potential up to two-loop order in a general $R_ξ$ gauge, and demonstrate that applying the $\hbar$-expansion yields gauge-independent results in excellent agreement with those obtained from a direct minimization of the loop-corrected potential. In contrast, large discrepancies between the two methods persist in the $4D$ approaches. We find that, across most of the parameter space, the $3D$ EFT approach provides the most robust predictions for phase-transition parameters and GW spectra, reducing theoretical uncertainties in the GW peak amplitude by more than an order of magnitude compared to the $4D$ calculations. We point out, however, that the $3D$ EFT approach is subject to an additional theory uncertainty from truncating the EFT at finite operator dimension and show that higher-dimensional operators within the $3D$ EFT approach can substantially modify the predicted transition strength and GW signals. This indicates a potential breakdown of the high-temperature expansion precisely in the region with the lowest transition temperatures, where the strongest GW signals are expected and the detection prospects with LISA are most promising.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14831v1,human
Uncharted Logarithmic Structures in QCD Transverse-Energy Flow,"We investigate the QCD transverse-energy ($E_T$) flow distribution within an azimuthal region of phase space, defined by an angular interval $Δφ$ on the plane transverse to a chosen jet axis. Vetoes on the resulting $E_T$ are widely employed at the LHC to isolate missing transverse momentum in final states with invisible particles. We show that this observable has logarithmic structures never seen before in QCD calculations. Notably, its description involves the resummation of non-global and coherence-violating logarithmic contributions that are more singular than any reported to date. We analyze its all-orders behavior, providing analytical resummations at next-to-double-logarithmic accuracy for $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, and numerical resummations at leading-logarithmic accuracy in the Veneziano limit for $pp$ collisions. We further present a computation of the leading coherence-violating correction for $pp$ collisions. The intricate structure of vetoes in azimuthal gaps reveals new aspects of QCD dynamics and offers a novel probe of collinear-factorization breaking at the LHC.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14681v1,human
Closing in on $α$-attractors,"Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $α$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $α$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w>1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $α$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $α\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincaré models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14673v1,human
Probing the Phenomenology of Dark Matter from Decoupled Freeze-Out,"We consider a model of dark matter where the mediator corresponds to a superposition of a scalar and pseudoscalar, and the scenario where, after reheating, the number densities of the dark sector particles, i.e. the dark matter and the mediators, are negligible. If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector. We finally perform a thorough analysis of experimental bounds on this scenario, namely from indirect detection and the CMB, as well as from BBN, and find that, while there are considerable constraints on the parameter space where the correct relic density is obtained, a viable region remains to be explored.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14635v1,human
Impact of conversion-driven processes on singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter relic,"The singlet-doublet dark matter model offers a rich framework for exploring the nature of dark matter (DM) through its unique fermion structure. In this model, the important parameters are singlet-doublet mass splitting $Δ{M}$, singlet-doublet mixing angle $\sinθ$, and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$. If the DM is assumed to be of Dirac nature, then the annihilation, co-annihilation, and conversion driven processes combinedly allows a range of parameter space: $1~{\rm GeV} \lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim750$ GeV and $10^{-6}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.04$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV. While the nature of DM either Dirac or Majorana is not known, in this work we assume the nature of singlet-doublet DM to be of Majorana type and find that the relic density and direct detection can be satisfied in a larger parameter space. In particular, the allowed ranges of DM mass and $\sinθ$ are: $1~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim1750$ GeV and $2\times10^{-7}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.16$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14571v1,human
Systems with Quantum Dimensions,"We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14547v1,human
Early Universe Constraints on Variations in Fundamental Constants Induced by Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter,"We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14532v1,human
Charged Higgs bosons associated with neutral gauge bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders,"The first results for charged Higgs pair production associated with neutral gauge bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders are presented within the framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. In the phenomenological studies for the production processes, we first update the parameter space of the Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. From the viable regions of the parameter space, we compute the production cross sections, including all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson. We mention that all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson are evaluated with one-loop electroweak corrections, with two-loop QCD corrections also included for the decays of the charged Higgs into two fermions. The signal significances are also examined for several benchmark points within the updated parameter space. It is worth emphasizing that the production cross sections used for computing the significances in this work include initial-state radiation corrections up to two-loop order. With the help of the high integrated luminosity planned for future multi--TeV muon colliders, the production signals can be observed with a statistical significance exceeding $5σ$ for several selected points within the allowed parameter space.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14525v1,human
Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes,"We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506v2,human
Parton distributions with higher twist and jet power corrections,"We present a global determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that accounts for higher twist corrections in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and linear power corrections for single inclusive jet and dijet production data from the LHC. We determine these corrections and their associated correlated uncertainties using a methodology based on the theory covariance formalism, previously used to account for nuclear uncertainties and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) in global PDF determinations. We then study the impact of the power corrections on the extracted PDFs, and demonstrate an improved description of the data due to a reduced sensitivity to DIS data in the low-$x$ region where higher twist uncertainties are relatively large, and a reduced sensitivity to single inclusive jet data at relatively low $p_T$, where linear power corrections can be significant. Finally, we assess the impact of power corrections on observables relevant to LHC phenomenology, including Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the determination of $α_s$. We find that these effects, while small, can be significant, improving perturbative convergence.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14387v1,human
Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems,"High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/α$, the ``saturon"" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2π)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/α_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/α_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14381v1,human
LinApart2: efficient parallel partial fraction decomposition algorithm for denominators with polynomials of general degree,"We present LinApart2, a major update to the LinApart algorithm for univariate partial fraction decomposition. Unlike its predecessor, LinApart2 can handle denominators of arbitrary polynomial degree without explicit factorization, while retaining the efficiency and parallelizability of the Laurent series method. Benchmarks show substantial speedups in both runtime and memory usage compared to Mathematica's built-in routine Apart and to the Euclidean algorithm, enabling computations that were previously intractable.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15735v1,human
Vortex stability in pseudo-Hermitian theories,"Pseudo-Hermitian (including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) field theories support phenomenology that cannot be replicated in standard Hermitian theories. We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14300v1,human
Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories,"In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $φ$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(φ, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)<{\cal C}<{\cal O}(0.1)$.

Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model,"Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0, π_0, η, η'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent coupling constant. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $π_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The behavior of $m_{π_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $η$ and $η'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The mass of $η$ meson $m_η$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_η$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $η'$ mesons is a resonant state in vacuum and in medium, and its mass $m_{η'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0, π_0, η$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In the PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,\ π_0$ mesons ($ η$ meson) decrease (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to the lower value for meson Mott transition temperature.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14150v1,human
"Inclusive $J/ψ$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model","We investigate the inclusive $J/ψ$ productions in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Several $J/ψ$ production mechanisms are considered: the leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-singlet and color-octet contributions, the cluster collapse mechanism, and the non-prompt $J/ψ$ from $b$-hadron decays. The simulated inclusive $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/ψ$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $ψ(2S)$, $χ_{c0}$, $χ_{c1}$, and $χ_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $χ_{c2}$ ($χ_{c1}$) feed-down. The $ψ(2S)$ feed-down fraction is 8-9$\%$, while the $χ_{c0}$ contribution is around 2-3$\%$. The influence of the partonic and hadronic rescatterings is also examined. The partonic rescattering exhibits negligible impact on the $J/ψ$ yields across all production mechanisms. In contrast, the hadronic rescattering suppresses the $J/ψ$ productions from both the NRQCD and cluster collapse mechanisms, while leaving the non-prompt $J/ψ$ yield almost unaffected.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14105v1,human
Magnetic field induced anomalous pion couplings,"Effective pion-constituent quark couplings induced by relatively weak magnetic fields are calculated, being that they disappear in the vacuum. In particular, couplings to a scalar and a vector constituent quark currents are investigated. These couplings can correspond to a fluctuation of the neutral pion into a scalar quark-antiquark meson and to a vector meson respectively. Some possible phenomenological implications are discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14053v1,human
"Exact, non-singular black holes from a phantom DBI Field as primordial dark matter","We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14047v1,human
Exploring pion emission properties of (strange) hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks in a chiral quark model,"The internal structure of the exotic $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ pentaquarks remains an open question. To address this, we demonstrate that pion emission serves as a sensitive probe by calculating its properties within a molecular scenario using the chiral quark model and coupled-channel effects. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the decay widths on the internal structure and spatial wave functions. We therefore expect this study to stimulate experimental measurements of these decays, which are crucial for determining the nature of these states and guiding the search for further molecular partners.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14046v1,human
Hybrid to Quarkonia transitions,"Hybrid quarkonia -exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom- have gained increasing attention in hadron spectroscopy, particularly with the ongoing discovery of new XYZ mesons. In this work, we update the spectrum of heavy hybrid mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors using the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, by incorporating the latest lattice QCD results for hybrid static potentials. We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results. We compare them to experimental data of the Particle Data Group, which allows us to identify hybrid candidates among the observed XYZ states. We provide hybrid or quarkonium interpretations for nearly all heavy isospin-zero mesons observed and incorporate new hybrid candidates.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14016v1,human
The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion,"A massive ""dark companion""-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a ""scoured"" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858v1,human
Subleading Color Corrections at Three Loops to the $\operatorname{tr}(φ^2)$ Three-Point Form Factor in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory,"We compute three-loop corrections to the three-point form factor of the operator $\operatorname{tr}(φ^2)$ in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, our result is valid beyond the leading-color limit and will consequently be an important input towards extending the amplitude-bootstrap program beyond the leading-color approximation.

Effects of Lighter-than-QCD Axions on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability,"Finite density corrections to the lighter-than-QCD axion can invert the effective axion potential, sourcing a non-trivial axion field inside dense objects. We perform the first numerical study of the complete dynamics of the lighter-than-QCD axion in a neutron star in 1+1 general relativity, extending the region of analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths. We calculate gravitational effects of the axion field on the neutron star and show that for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants, neutron star properties, such as the mass, radius, and compactness, are affected at the order-1 level. This result indicates that approximate universal tidal deformability-compactness relation for neutron stars is non-trivially broken and can serve as a probe of lighter-than-QCD axions, independent of the unknown nuclear equation of state. We comment on the potential for axion studies with future gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars and applications of this work to other new physics signatures.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13812v1,human
Coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations on Kerr Spacetime,"We extend our previous Schwarzschild metric-based studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642v3,human
Sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs with an improved liquid argon ionization response model within the DarkSide programme,"Dark matter detection experiments using liquid argon rely on a precise characterization of the ionization response to nuclear recoils, especially in the keV energy range relevant for light dark matter interactions. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis that combines new measurements from the ReD setup, part of the DarkSide experimental program, with calibration data from DarkSide-50, as well as results from the ARIS and SCENE experiments. These combined datasets enable improved constraints on atomic screening effects in the modeling of the ionization response of liquid argon to nuclear recoils. By including the updated ionization model into the DarkSide-50 analysis framework, we obtain stronger exclusion limits on low-mass WIMP interactions, setting new world-leading constraints in the 1-3 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass range. Finally, we recast the sensitivity projections for the upcoming DarkSide-20k detector, demonstrating a significantly enhanced discovery potential for low-mass dark matter candidates.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13629v1,human
Probing Dark Sector Particles Coupling to Neutrinos with Double Beta Decay,"Motivated by the observation of non-zero neutrino masses and the potential for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model, numerous experiments are actively searching for neutrinoless double beta $(0νββ)$ decay. In all of these searches, a substantial amount of data on two-neutrino double beta $(2νββ)$ decay has been collected. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of current and future double beta decay experiments to a massive Majoron-like scalar particle coupled to neutrinos and potentially dark sector fermions, and compare their reach to the relevant cosmological constraints. On- and off-shell production of such scalar particles leads to characteristic distortions in the double beta decay electron spectrum. We investigate how these distortions would manifest in current and future double beta decay experiments, deriving the sensitivity to such scenarios. We project the reach of future experiments which can probe scalar-neutrino couplings of $|a_ν| \approx 2\times 10^{-6}$ for sub-MeV scalar particles and remain sensitive to off-shell production above the Q-value of double beta decay isotopes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13606v1,human
Complex Scalar Singlet Model: Electroweak Phase Transition and Gravitational Waves,"The Standard Model (SM) cannot explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), thus driving the need for physics beyond the SM, which can generate electroweak baryogenesis through a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOPT). We extend the SM with a complex singlet scalar (cxSM) and examine the phase transition behavior using a fully general renormalizable scalar potential that permits a complex vacuum expectation value for the singlet and coupled dynamics among multiple scalar fields. Employing the one-loop thermal effective potential with daisy resummation and appropriate counter terms, we conduct an extensive scan of the parameter space, enforcing both theoretical and experimental limits on the scalar sector. This analysis reveals viable domains yielding SFOPT. From these regions, we select representative benchmark scenarios demonstrating multi-stage transitions, producing stochastic gravitational wave signals via bubble nucleation dynamics. The resulting spectra lie within the projected sensitivity of next-generation observatories, including LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and U-DECIGO. Thus, the cxSM offers a compelling setting for electroweak baryogenesis, enriched by correlated gravitational-wave and collider phenomenology.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13426v1,human
Anomalous Higgs Couplings as a Window to New Physics,"Throughout this thesis, we investigate how effective field theories, combined with unitarization techniques, can be used to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, with particular emphasis on the dynamical origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. Since effective theories often produce amplitudes that violate unitarity at high energies, restoring unitarity is essential before comparing predictions with data.   The first part of the work focuses on longitudinal $WW$ scattering, a process that, despite being subdominant at the LHC, provides a sensitive probe of Higgs dynamics. We perform a full one-loop computation within the HEFT framework, determine the required counterterms in the on-shell scheme, and analyze for the first time how the inclusion of transverse gauge bosons modifies the masses and widths of the dynamical resonances obtained through unitarization in the vector--isovector and scalar--isoscalar channels. This provides the technical foundation for studying HEFT low-energy couplings subject to unitarity and causality.   While vector resonances are relatively well characterized through Weinberg sum rules and unitarization, scalar resonances remain more elusive and depend on HEFT parameters that are experimentally difficult to constrain. We show that unitarization, together with causality, imposes nontrivial bounds on Higgs self-interactions. In the scalar channel, the necessity of treating coupled processes becomes a key ingredient, enabling us to extract information about the Higgs sector from elastic $WW \to WW$ scattering without requiring double-Higgs production.   Finally, we apply the formalism developed throughout the thesis to unitarize the amplitudes of a quantum theory of gravity treated as an effective field theory, illustrating the broader applicability of these methods.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13227v1,human
Roles of $Λ$ resonances in the $K^- p \to γΣ$ reaction,"We investigate the $K^- p \to γΣ$ reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach within an isobar model framework. The model includes contributions from $s$-channel hyperon and hyperon resonance, $t$-channel $K$ and $K^*$, $u$-channel proton and $Δ(1232)$ exchanges, and a phenomenological contact term. Our analysis focuses on the roles of various $Λ$ resonances. The results indicate that the $Λ(1600)$ resonance is crucial for describing the experimental data at lower energies. At higher energies, the inclusion of either the $Λ(1670)$ or the $Λ(1690)$ resonance significantly improves the agreement with data. However, the current data are insufficient to distinguish between these two scenarios. We suggest that future measurements at higher beam energies and the measurement of the $Σ$ polarization are needed to identify the roles of the $Λ(1670)$ and $Λ(1690)$ resonances.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13157v1,human
Background Field Effects on Quasi-Real Photon Emission and Lepton-Pair Production at EIC and EicC,"We study how background electromagnetic fields modify quasi-real photon emission at the EIC and EicC through an effective coupling correction, thereby altering the photon flux spectrum. The resulting change in lepton-pair production via photon-photon fusion, where one photon arises from the electron and the other from the nuclear Coulomb field-serves as a clean QED probe of such background effects. In our formulation, the correction originates from a non-perturbative modification of the photon propagator induced by the background field. Because this process shares the same initial-state photon dynamics as photon-gluon fusion, any background-induced alteration of the photon propagator directly impacts the extraction of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Numerical estimates at realistic collider energies indicate that these corrections should be non-negligible in certain kinematic regions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14800v1,human

We obtain the mass spectrum of the hidden-charm-doubly-strange pentaquark states with the isospin-spin-parity $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}{\frac{1}{2}}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{5}{2}}^-$, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future, especially the process $Ξ_b^- \to P_{css}^-φ\to J/ψΞ^- φ$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13067v1,human
A Study of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ Nature : Compact v.s. Molecule,"A central question in exotic-hadron physics is their internal structure whether these states are loosely bound hadronic molecules or compact multiquark configurations. To shed light on this issue, we develop a model that incorporates mixing between hadronic-molecular and compact multiquark components. We then apply this framework to the specific case of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and analyze the peak structure in the $D^0D^0π^+$ invariant-mass spectrum reported by LHCb. We find that a scenario based on a predominantly compact tetraquark provides the best fitted solution which can explain the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. We also find that the model admits two more solutions of comparable quality, both of which imply that the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a molecular state: (1) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*+}D^0$ molecule and there is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecular state in addition; (2) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecule and an aditional $D^{*+}D^0$ molecular state is found below $D^0D^0π^+$ threshold. These molecular states are not simple $I = 0$ states, but mixtures of $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ states. We show that all three scenarios are also consistent with the experimentally observed near-threshold $D^0D^0$ and $D^0D^+$ invariant-mass distributions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13003v1,human
Quantum decoherence signatures in charmless non-leptonic $B$ decays,"Quantum coherence plays a crucial role in the dynamics of neutral meson systems, aiding in the extraction of various Standard Model parameters. However, real physical systems always interact with their surroundings, which causes decoherence. In case of time dependent analysis of non-leptonic neutral $B$ meson decays, this decoherence can be modeled using a single parameter, $λ$. Since decoherence can affect the observed dynamics of flavor oscillations and CP violation, it becomes essential to revisit the key SM parameters such as the CKM angles $(α, β, γ)$ and the mass differences of neutral $B$ mesons ($Δm_{d,s}$). In this work, we study the CKM phase $β$ as well as the penguin contributions in the $B_d^0 \to J/ψK_S$ decay mode in the presence of decoherence. We employ the pseudo-experiment (Toy Monte-Carlo) technique and perform an $SU(3)_F$ analysis using the $B_d^0 \to J/ψπ^0$ process. Furthermore, we investigate the $B_d^0 \to π^+ π^-$ decay mode to understand how the decoherence influences the CP violating observables.

Axial charges and magnetic moments of the decuplet pentaquark family,"We present a systematic calculation of the axial charges and magnetic moments for the decuplet of hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks within the framework of the constituent quark model. Our findings reveal that the axial charges of these states are comparable in magnitude to that of the nucleon. Furthermore, we find that their magnetic moments obey a set of sum rules (denoted the Hao-Song sum rules) which hold for states sharing the same spin-flavor configuration, even in the presence of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking.

HadroTOPS: A Monte Carlo Event Generator For Hadron Production In Two-Photon Scattering In Electron Positron Collisions,"We present a Monte Carlo event generator specifically developed for the study of hadronic two-photon fusion events in two-photon scattering at electron-positron colliders. The code enables the generation of events with exact leading-order QED coupling and a flat phase space decay of the hadronic state into an arbitrary number of final state particles as selected by the user. Thus, this generator is well-suited for the use of partial wave analyses tools to study the two-photon production of higher-multiplicity final states across a wide range of energies and photon virtualities. Furthermore, the code integrates both experimental and theoretical inputs on the two-photon couplings of hadrons to simulate two-photon production processes. Motivated by the investigations of the BESIII collaboration, the final states $π^+π^-$, $π^0π^0$, $π^0η$, $K^+K^-$, $K^0_SK^0_S$, $ηη$, and $f_1(1285)\to ηπ^+π^-$ via $a_0^\pm(980)π^\mp$ and $f_0(500)η$ are currently included.

Resurrecting the Standard Model Effective Field Theory interferences at colliders,"Even if some experimental evidence suggests the existence of physics beyond the SM, no clues of new resonances can be found in the data. In the case their masses are much larger than the energies of current experiments, the SMEFT formalism can be used to introduce new operators that parametrise small deviations from the SM predictions at the LHC, induced by interactions between the known and new states. This thesis focuses on some operators and processes for which the leading correction to the SM, namely its interference with dimension-6 operators, is suppressed, either because it is small all over the phase space as a result of a helicity mismatch in the SM and SMEFT amplitudes, or because a cancellation between large cross-section contributions with opposite sign occurs. Several useful quantities are introduced to distinguish among these two cases, and a phenomenological strategy to revive the interferences is developed. They are applied to the cases of the $O_G$ and $O_W$ operators, respectively in three-jet production and EW processes like VBF $Zjj$, $WZ$ and $Wγ$. The comparison among them highlights how different procedures can be followed to restore the interference. The quantities introduced in this thesis can be used to find simple kinematic observables that are sensitive to the suppression and can yield competitive bounds on the coefficients of the operators, even outside the SMEFT validity region. In the last chapter, a study of ten four-light quark operators is presented at LO matched to parton shower. Individual and marginalised limits on them are obtained through multijet production and processes where the jets are generated together with EW bosons, like $Z, W, γ$+jets. Almost no interference suppression happens for these operators, but they can virtually affect any process at NLO.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12673v1,human
Thermal Quarkyonic Matter and Its Implications for Neutron Star Structure,"The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12669v1,human
Tomography of high-twist proton structure through $ep$ elastic scattering,"We present the first high-twist study of the proton form factors $F_{1,2}(Q^2)$ in $ep$ elastic scattering based on the perturbative QCD $k_T$ factorization, $Q^2$ being momentum transfer squared. It is motivated by unexpectedly large higher-power contributions from subleading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which are attributed to the enhancement in endpoint regions of parton momentum fractions. We highlight that the endpoint enhancement, tamed by the $k_T$ resummation effect, is crucial for accommodating the approximate scaling behavior of the $Q^4F_1(Q^2)$ data at intermediate $Q^2\sim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV$^2$. The proton LCDAs up to twist 6 are then extracted, and verified by the charge-parity asymmetries observed in the heavy baryon decays $Λ_b\to pπ, pK$. Our work provides new insights into the proton three-dimensional structure and manifests the precision requirement for reliable perturbative analyses of baryonic exclusive processes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12589v1,human
Simplification of chiral nuclear forces near the unitarity limit,"Modern theory approaches for describing atomic nuclei often make use of on an effective theory that constructs the interaction between nucleons systematically based on Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), exploiting constraints arising from the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. The tensor nuclear force produced by one-pion exchange is an important feature that arises naturally in this framework. In this work we show that, however, the tensor force is suppressed by the large nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths in combination with the smallness of the pion mass. Based on this observation, we propose a new scheme for a chiral nuclear force that is able to describe $NN$ phase shifts up to the center-of-mass momenta $k \simeq 300$ MeV while treating pion exchange as a perturbation. Our much simplified leading-order force provides a microscopic explanation for the recent success of various short-range nuclear forces from the perspective of chiral effective field theory, and it shares with those approaches an approximate Wigner SU(4) symmetry, as well as the closeness to the unitarity limit (infinite nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths), as guiding principles. Compared to previous approaches to perturbative-pion interactions, our force also adjusts the ordering of short-range contact interactions, by means of which we overcome convergence problems of the expansion that were previously assumed to severely limit its usefulness. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with numerical calculations of $NN$ scattering up to fourth order, in addition to studies of $3N$ and $4N$ bound-state properties.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12522v1,human
Vortex states and entanglement properties in multiphoton pair production,"We investigate the multiphoton pair production in circularly polarized field via two level model. There appears obvious discrete ring structures in the momentum distribution of the created particles, in which the ring radius is mainly controlled by the number of the photons absorbed in the creation with the energy conservation and could also be modulated by the spin of the created pair. These multiphoton rings become narrower when both of the pair particles' spin are aligned with the direction of the field rotation, and become broader if both spin are antiparallel to that direction. This spin-modulation can be simply understood with the angular momentum conservation, as less orbital angular momentum from the absorbed photons would be transferred to the created particles if their spins are aligned with the field rotation. The orbital angular momentum of the created particles is manifested as the vortex structure in the phase of the momentum distribution, and valued as the topological charge of this phase vortex. We also study the spin entanglement between the created particles, and reveal that the entanglement becomes stronger with the increase of the particles' transverse momentum, and gets sharp peak in the transition between different multiphoton rings, where the topological charge of the phase vortex is changed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12475v1,human
Normalization of partial wave CP asymmetries in three-body decays of heavy hadrons,"CP violation in hadronic multi-body decays has been extensively studied, and the experimental breakthrough in the heayy baryon sector was made recently. Partial-Wave CP Asymmetries (PWCPAs) in multi-body decays of heavy hadrons, which although provide us with more interference information, suffer from the normalization problem, as is pointed out in this paper. We propose a novel solution to this problem. We introduce a set of extra factors to rescale the PWCPAs to the proper sizes. Instead of determining the set of factors according to the normalization requirement, we demand that all the PWCPAs have the same statistical errors. In this way, we obtain a set of quasi-normalized PWCPAs, in the sense that they are close to the ideal normalized ones. As an application, we perform an analysis of PWCPAs in the decay channel $B^\pm\toπ^+π^-π^\pm$. We focus on the phase space region where the invariant mass of the $π^+π^-$ pair varies around the vector resonance $ρ^0(1450)$. Based on the data of the LHCb collaboration, the interference patterns among the resonances $ρ^0(1450)$, $f_2(1270)$, and $f_0(1500)$ and their contributions to the quasi-normalized PWCPAs are analyzed. The analysis indicates that the quasi-normalized PWCPAs can avoid potential misleading or distorted results comparing with some other alternatively defined ones.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12445v1,human
Tensor form factors of the $Δ^+$ baryon induced by isovector and isoscalar currents in QCD,"The tensor form factors of the $Δ^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $Δ^+ \rightarrow Δ^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and time-reversal symmetry. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observed differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $Δ^+$ baryon.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12360v1,human
Improving Neutrino Oscillation Measurements through Event Classification,"Precise neutrino energy reconstruction is essential for next-generation long-baseline oscillation experiments, yet current methods remain limited by large uncertainties in neutrino-nucleus interaction modeling. Even so, it is well established that different interaction channels produce systematically varying amounts of missing energy and therefore yield different reconstruction performance--information that standard calorimetric approaches do not exploit. We introduce a strategy that incorporates this structure by classifying events according to their underlying interaction type prior to energy reconstruction. Using supervised machine-learning techniques trained on labeled generator events, we leverage intrinsic kinematic differences among quasi-elastic scattering, meson-exchange current, resonance production, and deep-inelastic scattering processes. A cross-generator testing framework demonstrates that this classification approach is robust to microphysics mismodeling and, when applied to a simulated DUNE $ν_μ$ disappearance analysis, yields improved accuracy and sensitivity. These results highlight a practical path toward reducing reconstruction-driven systematics in future oscillation measurements.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11938v1,human
Through the Heliospheric Lens: Directional Deflection of High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Electrons and Positrons,"We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this ""heliospheric lens"" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11936v1,human
The weak decay constant of positronium,"The positronium, as the lightest purely leptonic bound state, provides an ideal testing ground for a quantum field--theoretical (QFT) description of composite systems. While its electromagnetic annihilation is well understood as the dominant decay channel, the weak interaction sector of positronium is strongly suppressed. In this work, we extend the composite QFT framework previously developed for the two--photon decay and introduce the concept of a weak decay constant for para--positronium. This constant, defined in analogy with those of pseudoscalar mesons, quantifies the coupling of the positronium field to the weak axial current and serves as a measure of its internal structure in the electroweak domain. Its numerical value $ f_{P} \simeq \frac{m_{e}}{2\sqrtπ} α^{3/2} = 89.8593~\mathrm{eV} $ is, as expected, small. Nevertheless, the resulting expression and a related comparison to quarkonium systems allow us to determine the vertex function linking the positronium to its own constituents.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11839v1,human
Two-loop all-plus helicity amplitudes for self-dual Higgs boson with gluons via unitarity cut constraints,"We present the two-loop amplitudes for a self-dual Higgs boson with up to four positive helicity gluons in the heavy top-quark limit. Because the tree amplitudes in the all-plus sector vanish, we can construct simple representations of the polylogarithmic parts of the two-loop amplitudes using four-dimensional unitarity cuts into rational one-loop and tree amplitudes. The remaining rational function ambiguity is extracted from a tensor integral reduction over finite fields. The final expressions are presented using polylogarithms up to weight two and compact rational functions of spinor-helicity products.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11537v1,human
Higher-order QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a jet,"The production of a top-quark pair, the heaviest known elementary particle, in association with a light jet is a key process for studying the properties of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Due to its significance as a signal process with considerable sensitivity to the top-quark mass and as a background process for new physics searches, it is crucial to predict differential cross sections with high precision. In this article, we present, for the first time, predictions for various kinematical observables at next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics. The perturbative behavior is analyzed, and uncertainties arising from missing higher-order contributions are substantially reduced. The necessary two-loop amplitudes have been evaluated in the leading-color approximation, and we provide estimates for the impact of the missing contributions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11431v2,human
Double virtual QCD corrections to $t\bar{t}+$jet production at the LHC,"We present a leading colour computation of the double virtual contributions to top-quark pair production in association with a jet at a hadron collider at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. The finite remainders of the two-loop amplitudes, after subtraction of infrared and ultraviolet divergences, are extracted analytically from evaluations over finite fields by using a (potentially) overcomplete basis of special functions defined through their differential equations. We construct the colour- and spin-summed interference with the tree-level amplitudes and present a \texttt{C++} library suitable for immediate use in phenomenological studies. We present new techniques for the evaluation of the special functions through direct numerical integration of differential equations which perform well across the full physical phase space.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11424v1,human
Effects of Early-Universe Inhomogeneity on Bubble Formation: Primordial Black Holes as an Extreme Case,"Our early Universe is not perfectly homogeneous and it may contain some inhomogeneous sources, which might distort the local spacetime and modify the bubble nucleation rate. Taking the primordial black hole as an extreme example, we investigate the bubble nucleation rate of a first-order phase transition in the vicinity of primordial black holes or other primordial gravitational sources. Our analysis reveals that the presence of primordial black holes can reduce the effective action and might modify the nucleation rate due to their gravitational effects, potentially altering the dynamics of the phase transition in the early universe and producing new gravitational wave signals since the gravitational effects of the primordial black hole or other possible inhomogeneous sources could lead to nucleation of non-spherical symmetric bubbles.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11408v1,human
An EFT approach to the study of multi-phase criticality scenarios,"Multi-phase critical scenarios explain the observed Higgs boson mass scale by the almost simultaneous occurrence of two smoothly connected phases of the theory, which differ by the selected vacuum configuration. A generic prediction of the framework is the presence of a further light scalar state, the dilaton, which naturally couples weakly to the Higgs boson. The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields. The analysis improves on the approximated results available in the Literature and explores the phenomenology of the model at collider and dark matter experiments. We find that the running of scalar couplings in the EFT between the two scales cannot be ignored, but the quantum corrections from the dark matter candidate are not noticeably modified.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11367v1,human
Weak decays of Bc meson in a QCD potential model,"The leptonic and semileptonic decay propertis of Bc mesons are studied in a QCD potential model. The CKM element for the leptonic decay is calculated by evaluating its decay constant. With the help of the Isgur-Wise function, the form factors and the CKM element for semileptonic decay are also calculated. The variation in four-momentum square in the two decays demands two different scales of the strong coupling constant α_s. Thus, a two-scale picture is evident from the study. We compute the decay constant f_p for leptonic decay and form factors for semileptonic decay with two different \alpbda scales in a specific prescription where it is related to the strong coupling α_s. Within the potential model, we find the scale for leptonic decay is λ\le 0.150 GeV and for semileptonic decay is \lamda \ge 0.410 GeV.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11280v1,human
Toward a holographic realization of the 2+1-flavor QCD phase structure,"We present a fully back-reacted Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--flavor model with dynamical light and strange sectors, calibrated to lattice QCD using a machine-learning--assisted spectral method. The model reproduces the 2+1-flavor equation of state and chiral dynamics with quantitative accuracy, and maps the Columbia plot with a tri-critical point at $m_s^{\mathrm{tri}} \simeq 21~\text{MeV}$ and a critical mass $m_c \simeq 0.785~\text{MeV}$, consistent with lattice results. At finite density, it yields a crossover-to-first-order transition and predicts a critical endpoint at $T_C = 75.4~\text{MeV}$ and $μ_C = 768~\text{MeV}$, within the reach of heavy-ion experiments. These findings establish a unified holographic framework for the QCD phase structure across quark masses and baryon density, providing the first consistent and quantitative description of both deconfinement and chiral transitions within a single holographic model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11273v2,human
Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons,"Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a ""dark photosphere"" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219v1,human
NJL-Chiral Soliton and the Nucleon Equation of State at supra-saturation density: Impact of Chiral Symmetry Restoration,"It has been conjectured that, at sufficiently high baryon densities, the equation of state (EoS) of bulk nuclear matter can be identified with that of the nucleon core. In this work, we illustrate how the energy density and pressure distributions inside individual nucleons can be utilized to construct the EoS of supra-dense matter. In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11167v1,human
Valence quark distribution of rho meson using light-front quark model,"We investigate the partonic structure of the $ρ$ meson, the lightest spin-$1$ vector meson, within the light-front quark model (LFQM). To explore the sensitivity to model assumptions, we employ two distinct types of spin wave functions in the LFQM. Using light-front helicity wave functions, we derive explicit expressions for the leading-twist and subleading-twist quark parton distribution functions (PDFs), and evolve the leading-twist PDFs to higher scales with next-to-leading order (NLO) Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution. We have also calculated the Mellin moment from the evolved PDFs using a simple neural network frame and compared with available theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we compute the full set of nine leading-twist transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) for the valence quark in the $ρ$ meson, including three tensor TMDs that arise from spin-$1$ tensor polarization of the hadron. Positivity constraints for the PDFs and TMDs are examined within this framework. Our findings highlight the crucial role of tensor polarization in shaping the three-dimensional partonic structure of vector mesons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10981v1,human
Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos,"The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10765v1,human

Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry from Monopole-Axion Interactions,"We introduce a novel mechanism where the kinetic energy of a rotating axion can be dissipated by the interactions with dark magnetic monopoles. This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10603v1,human
Toward a Comprehensive Exploration of Flavored Dark Matter Models,"We present a comprehensive framework for the study of flavored dark matter models, combining relic density calculations with direct and indirect detection limits, collider constraints, and a global analysis of flavor observables based on SMEFT matching and renormalization-group evolution. The framework applies to scalar or fermionic dark matter, including both self-conjugate and non-self-conjugate cases. As a proof of principle, we analyze two scenarios with Majorana dark matter coupling to right-handed charged leptons and to right-handed down-type quarks, assuming a thermal freeze-out. In the leptophilic case, flavor-violating decays such as $μ\to e γ$ dominate the constraints, while LHC searches still leave sizable parameter space. For quark couplings, direct detection bounds and meson mixing severely restrict the allowed couplings, favoring hierarchical flavor structures.

Phenomenology of Non-Abelian Gauge and Goldstone Bosons in a U(2) Flavor Model,"We investigate the phenomenological implications of the bosons associated with the $SU(2)_F$ subgroup in a simple and realistic $U(2)_F$ flavor model. While the PNGB of the $U(1)_F$ factor behaves as a standard QCD axion (an axiflavon) with suppressed flavor-violating couplings, the three degrees of freedom from $SU(2)_F$ have not been studied before. This work focuses on these states, considering both the case where $SU(2)_F$ is a global symmetry, yielding pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGBs), and the case where it is a gauge symmetry with a potentially small coupling, yielding a triplet of (possibly) light gauge bosons. In both scenarios, these new bosons naturally feature unsuppressed flavor-violating couplings to Standard Model fermions in the mass basis. We derive the resulting predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents and lepton flavor violation, including exotic decays of mesons and leptons. Our analysis shows that processes like $K \to πX$ and $μ\to e X$ place the most stringent constraints, probing the flavor symmetry breaking scale $v_φ$ up to $10^{11}-10^{12}$ GeV for light bosons, while heavier states are tested in $B$ and $τ$ decays, as well as by $K-\bar K$ mixing and $μ\to e γ$. We demonstrate that low-energy flavor experiments provide a powerful probe of this framework, capable of testing ultra-high symmetry breaking scales that surpass the limits set by astrophysical observations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10468v1,human
Updated branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in $D \to PV$ decays,"Motivated by extensive new high-precision experimental data, we present an updated analysis of the two-body charm decays $D \to PV$ (with $P =π,K, η^{(\prime)}$ and   $V =ρ, K^*, ω, φ$) within the   factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach. In the framework, flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effect is incorporated into the topological amplitudes, allowing the nonfactorizable contributions from topological diagrams to be expressed as a minimal set of universal parameters determined through a global fit to experimental data. Thanks to the sufficient data with high precision, we are now able to quantify the nonfactorizable contribution of so-called ``factorization"" $T$ diagram, which is essential for explaining the observed branching ratios. The parameters for the $C$, $E$, and $A$ diagrams are also updated with significant improved precision, and notably, the resulting strong phases differ substantially from those in the earlier FAT analysis. We find that the $C$ topological amplitude features substantial nonfactorizable effects in the charm sector. These refined parameters enable predictions of significantly improved accuracy, yielding branching ratios in good agreement with current data and the latest results in topological diagram approach, and the predicted direct $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries differ distinctly form previous FAT results due to updated strong phases. In several modes, the $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries are predicted to reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, thereby making them promising observables for future high-precision experiments at LHCb, BESIII and Belle II. Predictions for unobserved decay modes, especially those with branching fractions of order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-3}$, are also provided for forthcoming experimental tests.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10389v1,human
Primer of Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics for Experimentalists,"This document serves as a conceptual and practical introduction to Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics (SFQED), written from the standpoint of experimental physicists. It was developed in the context of the ""Strong-Field QED Workshop 2024"" at DESY, aimed at supporting early-career researchers entering the field from the experimental side. Rather than providing a comprehensive theoretical review, the document focuses on the core ideas, terminology, and challenges in SFQED that are most relevant to experimental design and interpretation.

Shedding Light on (Anti-)nuclei Production with Pion-Nucleus Femtoscopy,"High-energy nuclear collisions provide a unique environment for synthesizing both nuclei and antinuclei (such as $\bar{d}$ and $\overline{^4\text{He}}$) at temperatures ($k_BT\sim100$ MeV) nearly two orders of magnitude above their binding energies of a few MeV. The underlying production mechanism, whether through statistical hadronization, nucleon coalescence, or dynamical regeneration and disintegration, remains unsettled. Here we address this question using a novel tool of pion-nucleus femtoscopy. By solving relativistic kinetic equations for pion-catalyzed reactions ($πNN \leftrightarrow πd$) for deuteron production and including a $70~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$ downward shift of the in-medium $Δ(1232)$ mass, we successfully reproduce the resonance peaks observed by the ALICE Collaboration in both $π^+-p$ and $π^+-d$ femtoscopic correlation functions in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. We further find that the nucleon coalescence model reproduces only about half of the observed peak strength, while the statistical hadronization model predicts no resonance feature. These results provide compelling evidence that pion-catalyzed reactions play a dominant role in the production of light (anti-)nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions and cosmic rays.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10298v2,human
Probing thermal leptogenesis and dark matter through primordial gravitational waves from a supercooled universe,"We explore the cosmological dynamics of a supercooled first-order phase transition in the classically conformal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, where radiative symmetry breaking simultaneously generates the right-handed neutrino (RHN) masses, and a strong stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10288v1,human
Possible $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ resonances by solving Schrödinger equation,"The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schrödinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the particle $f_1(1285)$, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is obtained, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced with different coupling constants fixed with the binding energies of $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$, respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group simultaneously. This method is extended to study the $D \bar{D}^*$ system analogously. When the particle $χ_{c1}(3872)$ is treated as a bound state of $D \bar{D}^*$, the particles $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c \bar{c}}(4020)$ and $X(3940)$ can be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, which implies the spin and parity of these particles are all $J^P=1^+$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10145v1,human
Trapped and Unstable: Axion-like particle fragmentation at finite temperature,"We investigate the emergence of a resonant behavior in axion-trapped misalignment models featuring finite-temperature potential barriers. As the temperature decreases and the field is released from its trapped configuration, inhomogeneities are exponentially amplified through an instability in their equation of motion, leading to the fragmentation of the axion field. We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10086v1,human
Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon,"We investigate the pseudoscalar ($η_t$) and vector ($ψ_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($Ω_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5σ$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $Ω_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053v3,human
Composite Dissipation in Warm Inflation: Implications for the Primordial Power Spectrum,"Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $Υ(φ, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{φ^2}.$ The two terms in $Υ$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10024v1,human
Beam polarization precision requirements for future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories,"We present work on quantifying the minimum requirements for beam polarization precision at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories. We find that, under the assumption of a high electron beam polarization ($P_-$) that the positron polarization ($P_+$) is of key importance but for reasons both known and newly discovered. We have discovered that improved positron polarization leads to a less strict requirement on the beam polarization precision for measurements that scale only with the effective polarization, $P_\mathrm{eff}$. Conversely, measurements that scale with the product of beam polarizations, $P_-P_+$, such as those that contain the $eeZ$ or $eeγ$ vertex, have their polarization precision demands get more strict as positron polarization increases. We check the polarization precision demands for $10^{-3}$ on the Higgsstrahlung cross-section ($σ_{ZH}$) at 250~GeV, $10^{-4}$ on the electron left-right asymmetry ($A_{\rm e}$) at the Z pole, and $10^{-4}$ on the di-photon cross-section ($σ_{γγ}$) from the Z pole to 3~TeV. We find that, for measurements away from the Z pole, the goals can plausibly be attained if one can achieve precision on beam polarization better than $0.1\%$. For measurements of $A_{\rm e}$ at $10^{-4}$, colliders must do better than $0.02\%$ on beam polarization precision, or determine ways to upgrade their beam polarization values towards unity, where the requirements decrease to better than $0.15\%$.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09851v1,human
Semi-visible higgs decay as a probe for new invisible particles,"We discuss the HL-LHC sensitivity to probe new invisible particles including scalars and fermions using semi-visible Higgs decays. The kinematics of these decays allow new particle masses below $m\lesssim 50$ GeV. We carry out our analysis within the framework of a dark-SMEFT effective theory with operators up to dimension six and a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the new particles are odd and the SM particles are even. We compare our results to those obtained from considering the invisible $Z$-width, as well as simple perturbative unitarity arguments. Finally, we outline kinematic strategies at the LHC to distinguish different operator structures of the postulated invisible particles.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09778v1,human
Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II. Resonant Conversions in the Intergalactic Medium,"This is the second part in a pair of papers forecasting the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to dark photons, a highly motivated, simple extension of the Standard Model. Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $ε$ as low as $10^{-8}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09637v2,human
Octet scalars shaping LHC distributions in 4-jet final states,"We study properties of a hypothetical scalar particle, $Θ$, which is a color octet and an electroweak singlet. At hadron colliders, $Θ$ is pair produced through its QCD coupling to gluons, so that its mass determines the cross section. It decays at tree level into $q\bar q$ through dimension-5 operators, and at one loop into gluons. Thus, the main LHC signature of $Θ$ is a pair of dijets of equal invariant mass. The CMS search in this channel shows a $3.6σ$ excess over the QCD background for a dijet mass $M_{jj} \approx 0.95$ TeV, which can be due to $Θ$: its production cross section (65 fb for a real scalar) and the acceptance of the CMS event selection applied to $p p \to ΘΘ\to \! (q \bar q)(q \bar q)$ yield a rate consistent with the excess. Furthermore, the shape of the $dσ/d M_{jj}$ signal is in agreement with the CMS result. Given the data-driven background fit performed by CMS, we find that a complex scalar fits better the data than a real scalar. Besides the pair of dijets, testable LHC signals include a trijet-dijet topology, a $t\bar t$ pair plus a dijet resonance, as well as final states involving a Higgs, $W$ or $Z$ boson plus jets.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09632v1,human
Freezing-in the Axiverse,"The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09631v1,human
Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos,"Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $ε$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $ε$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09630v2,human
"Entanglement, Yang-Mills, and the Scattering Matrix as an SU(N)-equivariant Kernel","We study two-body scattering as an SU(N)-equivariant map acting on tensor-product representation spaces and analyze the entanglement generated by the $S$-matrix. This representation-theoretic perspective separates group structure from dynamics: the decomposition of $R\!\otimes\!R'$ fixes the invariant operator algebra and therefore the qualitative entangling power of the process. For particles in the fundamental representation, $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{SU}(N)}(N\!\otimes\!N)=\mathrm{Span}\{\mathbb{I},\mathbb{S}\}$, so only the identity and swap directions preserve separability, whereas generic combinations generate entanglement. Adjoint-adjoint scattering involves a larger invariant algebra involving $d$-tensors and is intrinsically entangling. In Yang-Mills theory one can use color-kinematics duality to show that the color kernel lies on a fixed ray of this operator space, yielding a universal maximum of the outgoing entanglement for scattering at right angles, $E_\star^{(2)}=\tfrac{3}{4}$ for $SU(2)$ and $E_\star^{(3)}\simeq0.91$, independent of kinematics. Dimension-six operators preserve this universality, while dimension-eight deformations populate new color sectors and shift $E_\star^{(N)}$, suggesting that entanglement in color space functions as a tomographic probe of effective operators. In helicity space, requiring maximally entangled inputs to scatter into maximally entangled outputs uniquely selects the Yang-Mills quartic coupling and enforces the color Jacobi identity, restating the on-shell Ward constraints as conditions on entanglement preservation. Our results suggest that the information-theoretic viewpoint unifies algebraic, geometric, and dynamical aspects of scattering.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09623v1,human
Cosmological Limits on Strong Dark Forces,"We showcase cosmology's ability to constrain long-range forces between dark matter particles. Specifically, we consider a fermionic dark matter interacting via a Yukawa-coupled light scalar, focusing on regimes where the dark forces are stronger than gravitational and yet unconstrained. We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09614v1,human
$L_μ-L_τ$ gauge bosons in beam dumps and supernovae,"We study the phenomenology of a sub-GeV $L_μ-L_τ$ gauge boson. We find discrepancies with existing literature in sensitivity projections for the upcoming SHiP experiment and in the treatment of supernovae cooling constraints. We present a quantitative analysis of different production modes in beam dumps and compare our results to previous work. In the context of supernovae, we re-evaluate the standard supernova cooling bounds from SN1987A and analyze additional supernova-based probes: diffusive cooling, constraints from the existence of low-energy supernovae, and the absence of a high-energy neutrino signal from SN1987A.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09619v1,human
Gauged Soft Recursion: On-Shell Construction of Goldstone-Gauge Amplitudes,"We present a new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. A central challenge is that gauge interactions break Adler's zero condition for charged scalars, invalidating the standard soft recursion. To overcome this, we introduce a ``gauged soft recursion'' that leverages the soft theorems of the gauge bosons themselves, combined with a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components where Adler's zero is partially restored. The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09403v1,human
A Methodology for Developing Foundational Transformer Models in Collider Physics Analysis,"We present a methodology for training foundational transformer models capable of processing collider data with diverse kinematic signatures. Our universal foundation model is designed for simultaneous analysis of all processes involving from one to four top-quarks production with their corresponding background processes. The approach employs multi-task pre-training on combined datasets of simulated events, enabling the model to capture the full spectrum of interaction physics while extracting universal patterns across different final states prior to task-specific fine-tuning. This unified architecture eliminates the need for separate analysis frameworks for different final signatures and specific tasks. The transformer-based pre-training strategy explicitly preserves unique interaction patterns through adaptive attention mechanisms while establishing cross-process correlations. We plan to demonstrate how this architecture maintains sensitivity to rare high-multiplicity topologies (3t and 4t) without compromising performance on conventional channels ($t\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\bar{t}H$), effectively bridging the gap between disparate analysis paradigms in collider physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09335v1,human
Self-Interaction of Super-Resonant Dark Matter,"The $Λ$CDM model, while successful on large cosmological scales, faces challenges on small scales. A promising solution posits that dark matter (DM) exhibits strong self-interaction, enhanced through the narrow resonance or Sommerfeld effects. We demonstrate that the ``super-resonance"" phenomenon, combining these effects, significantly amplifies the DM self-scattering cross section, enabling strong self-interactions for DM candidates in the $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV mass range. This mechanism also enhances the DM annihilation cross section, causing early kinetic decoupling that renders the standard Boltzmann equation inadequate. By implementing coupled Boltzmann equations, we achieve precise calculations of the relic density for super-resonant DM, aligning with observational constraints.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09306v1,human
Production of Light Dark Particles from Nonlinear Compton Scattering Between Intense Laser and Muon or Proton Beam,"The laser of an intense electromagnetic field promotes the studies of strong-field particle physics in high-intensity frontier. Particle accelerator facilities in the world produce high-quality muon and proton beams. In this work, we propose the nonlinear Compton scattering to light dark particles through the collision between intense laser pulse and muon or proton beam. We take light dark photon and axion-like particle as illustrative dark particles. The cross sections of relevant nonlinear Compton scattering to dark photon or axion-like particle are calculated. We also analyze the background processes with missing neutrinos. The prospective sensitivity shows that the laser-induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than about 1 MeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09279v1,human
Strongly intensive quantities for rapidity correlations of multiplicities,"Studies of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter created in nuclear collisions are typically carried out using event-by-event fluctuations. Well-known way to disentangle statistical and dynamical fluctuations is to construct special observables named strongly intensive which are free from trivial volume fluctuations. Within the color string model behavior of the second-order strongly intensive quantity $Σ$ is completely determined by the two-particle correlation function from a single string and the string fusion mechanism. In this paper, we analyze third-order strongly intensive observable for forward-backward rapidity correlations and test its behavior within the PYTHIA8 model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09259v1,human
Fermi-Dirac Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles in local equilibrium,"A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09580v1,human
Learning to Validate Generative Models: a Goodness-of-Fit Approach,"Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning-based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman--Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end model, known as FlowSim, developed to generate high-energy physics collision events. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09118v2,human
Analysis of the strong decays of the $Y(4660)$ in tetraquark scenario via the QCD sum rules,"Motivated by the enigmatic vector charmonium-like states, we investigate the strong decay behaviors of four kinds of tetraquark states, which are possible candidates for the $Y(4660)$, within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules based on rigorous quark-hadron duality. We take into account the vacuum condensates up to dimension 5 in the QCD side, and obtain the hadronic coupling constants therefore the partial decay widths of those states. The predicted width $61.5\pm7.3\,\rm{MeV}$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for the $Y(4660)$, which supports its interpretation as a $[sc][\bar{s}\bar{c}]$ tetraquark state with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09098v1,human
Emergent Dark Matter,"We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09034v1,human
"Correlations between heavy mesons and the creation of the charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons in high energy $pp$ collisions","The different QCD processes, which can produce a heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar Q$) pair, induce different correlations between the heavy quarks. Employing the EPOS4HQ event generator we study the consequences of these correlations and compare the calculation with experimental results on open and hidden heavy flavour mesons, measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We find that the measured correlations between heavy mesons are a direct image of the different production mechanisms, which contribute also in a different way to the transverse momentum distribution of open and hidden heavy flavour mesons. The latter are calculated in a Wigner density approach which also enables to reproduce quantitatively the measured $B_c$ spectra. This agreement allows conclusions on the spatial distribution of the heavy quark creation processes.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08796v1,human
Ward-Takahashi identity in light-front formalism for a bound state of fermions,"We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08740v1,human
Hunting for Neutrino Texture Zeros with Muon and Tau Flavor Violation,"We revisit the minimal type II seesaw mechanism generating the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^ν$, under the assumption that two entries of $M^ν$ vanish. Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^ν$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $μ\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $τ\to \barμee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^ν$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $τ$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08679v1,human
Hadronic CP Violation in the 2HDM,"We present the first complete two-loop calculation of the electric and chromo-electric dipole moments of the light quarks and the gluon, as well as contributions to CP-violating lepton-quark interactions, in the unconstrained two-Higgs doublet model. We include the most general Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets with the Standard Model fermions up to quadratic order, and allow for generic phases in the Higgs potential. We pay particular attention to a consistent treatment of all fermionic contributions in the low-energy effective theory, including a consistent renormalization-group summation of all leading-logarithmic effects. This latter part of the work is independent of the specific UV model and can generally be applied to a large class of models that do not introduce new light degrees of freedom.

Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: New Representations and Degenerate Limits,"The particle model building of cosmological collider physics often involves boost-breaking bilinear mixing between a heavy particle and the nearly massless inflaton mode. In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts. In particular, the inflaton bispectrum with triple massive exchanges can be expressed in terms of a trivariate Kampé de Fériet function and simpler hypergeometric functions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08677v1,human
Quantum tunneling from excited states in the steadyon picture,"Recent developments in the understanding of real-time path integrals led to the development of the ``steadyon picture'' for the semi-classical calculation of quantum tunneling rates. We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08670v1,human
"Quantum Spacetime Imprints: The 24-Cell, Standard Model Symmetry and Its Flavor Mixing","In our previous work \cite{FaragAli:2024jpo} we outlined an exploratory framework in which the 24-cell acts both as the quantum of spacetime and as a geometric representation of elementary particles. In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10685v1,human
Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Star Gravitational Instability,"We show that dark stars, which are dark-matter-powered stars in the early universe, can grow by accretion to masses in the range $\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^4\right )-\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^7\right)\,{M_\odot}$ before the general-relativistic Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability causes their dynamical collapse to black holes. These accreting dark star configurations avoid standard stellar nuclear- and weak-interaction evolution that would lead to their demise long before they reached this supermassive size. Remarkably, this mechanism for supermassive black hole (SMBH) genesis is relatively robust to initial dark star mass, formation epoch, accretion rate and its history. The SMBHs produced this way can serve as seeds for even larger SMBHs $({\gtrsim}10^9\,M_\odot)$ that have been discovered at high redshift.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08578v1,human
Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models,"Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546v1,human
Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period,"Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by ""softening"" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08384v1,human
Revisiting the Possibility of a Sharp Phase Transition in Cold Neutron Stars,"First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in cold neutron stars (NSs) have been extensively studied and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the densest matter visible in our Universe, although a strong consensus has yet to emerge. Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08380v1,human
Future Collider Perspectives on Higgs CP Violation,"The search for new sources of CP violation is a cornerstone of the beyond the Standard Model phenomenology programme at the LHC and beyond. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such searches at a range of future facilities with the aim of informing the currently unfolding future collider roadmap. Focussing on new sources of CP violation specifically in the gauge-Higgs sector, we demonstrate the outstanding potential held by future electron-positron and proton-proton colliders to reveal and identify BSM physics with direct relevance for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. In particular, the future colliders will provide an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to anomalous CP-violating interactions induced by dimension-six effective field theory operators when compared to the high-luminosity LHC programme.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08359v1,human
Probing low-mass dark matter from sub-MeV to sub-GeV with germanium-based quantum phononic spectroscopy,"We present a germanium phonon-to-charge transducer that integrates a slow-phonon phononic-crystal (PnC) region with radio-frequency quantum point-contact (RF-QPC) readout at 4 K, and we evaluate its dark-sector reach. A calibrated signal-collection model, which combines geometric guiding, propagation survival, and multiplicity-assisted primary-phonon detection, provides selection-corrected thresholds in the $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$~eV range and a background model informed by nanosecond timing gates and GHz-band power-spectral-density windows. Under standard halo assumptions, a 100 g module achieves projected sensitivity to DM-electron and DM-nucleon scattering at recoil energies below $10^{-2}$~eV, probing cross sections below $10^{-43}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for $m_χ\in [0.01,100]~\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ (with efficiencies and thresholds folded in). We present sensitivities for both heavy-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}=1$) and light-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}\propto 1/q^{2}$) benchmarks, quantify dominant systematics (threshold, phonon quality factor $Q$, and bulk defect densities), and outline a staged program toward kg$\cdot$yr exposures that begins to test models approaching the solar CE$ν$NS background.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08329v1,human
Analysis of the strong decay $X(4140)\rightarrow J/ψφ$ via the light-cone QCD sum rules,"In this article, we take the $X(4140)$ as the axialvector tetraquark state with the symbolic quark structure $[sc]_S[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_A+[sc]_A[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_S$, and calculate the width of the two-body strong decay $X(4140)\rightarrow J/ψφ$ within the framework of the light-cone sum rules. Different from the traditional light-cone sum rules, at the phenomenological side, we introduce parameters $C$ to eliminate the contaminations from the higher resonances and continuum states, and match the hadron side with the QCD side of the correlation function based on rigorous quark-hadron duality to obtain the stable QCD sum rules. Then we obtain the decay width $Γ(X(4140)\rightarrow J/ψφ)=145\pm21\, \text{MeV}$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data $162\pm21^{+24}_{-49 } \,\text{MeV}$ from the LHCb collaboration.

Good flavor search in $SU(5)$: a machine learning approach,"We revisit the fermion mass problem of the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory using machine learning techniques. The original $SU(5)$ model proposed by Georgi and Glashow is incompatible with the observed fermion mass spectrum. Two remedies are known to resolve this discrepancy, one is through introducing a new interaction via a 45-dimensional field, and the other via a 24-dimensional field. We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08154v1,human
Novel bounds on neutrino portal dark matter from leptonic meson decays,"We investigate the potential of leptonic meson decays $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$, where $M$ is a pseudo-scalar meson, as a probe of neutrino portal dark matter. The model of our focus features a neutral fermion $ψ$ and scalar $φ$, which are coupled predominantly to neutrinos in the form ${\cal L} \supset λ\,\overlineν_L\,φ\,ψ_R$. This interaction generates two corrections to the $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ observables. The first one is a novel three-body decay process $M \to \ell \barψφ$. This process is enabled by the splitting of the off-shell anti-neutrino $\barν_\ell$ into $ψ$ and $φ$ in the $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ diagram. The helicity suppression in $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ is absent in the three-body process, thereby forming a potentially large contribution to real experimental results, provided $ψ$ and $φ$ are invisible. The second one is one-loop radiative corrections to the weak vertex $W\ell \barν_\ell$, which do not modify the charged lepton spectrum but lead to enhancement or suppression of the partial $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ decay width. To demonstrate the ability of the leptonic meson decays to probe the neutrino portal dark matter, we compute two corrections analytically and compare the modified meson branching ratios with the experimental data on the lepton flavor universality of pion and Kaon decays. The resulting constraints turn out to surpass the existing bounds in a large part of parameter spaces.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08102v1,human
Detecting Parity-Violating Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Pulsar Polarization Arrays,"Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07956v1,human
On the role of induced electric field in the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect,"Whether the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect even exists or not has been the subject of long-standing debate. There are two factors complicating the problem. First, in the closed spacetime line integral of the vector potential that is thought to give the AB-phase shift, how to treat the time-varying vector potential is highly nontrivial. Second, the time-varying magnetic flux generates induced electric field even outside the solenoid. In the present paper, motivated by a recent work by Gao, we re-investigate the role of the induced electric field with the utmost care. This analysis reveals a highly nontrivial effect of the induced electric field, which turns out to be useful for verifying the very existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07775v1,human
Unified Pati-Salam from Noncommutative Geometry: Overview and Phenomenological Remarks,"The lack of clear new-physics signals at the LHC searches motivates models that can guide current and future collider searches. The spectral action principle within the noncommutative geometry (NCG) framework yields such models with distinctive phenomenology. This formalism derives the actions of the Standard Model, General Relativity, and beyond from the underlying algebra, putting them on a common geometric footing. Certain versions of Pati-Salam (PS) models with gauge coupling unification and limited scalar content can be derived from an appropriate noncommutative algebra. In this paper, I review these gauge-coupling-unified Pati-Salam models and discuss their phenomenological aspects, focusing on the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07672v1,human
Prompt diphoton production at ATLAS 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: a comparative analysis of UPDF models,"We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tre--level $q + \bar q\!\to\!γ+γ$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!γ+ γ+ g$, and $q + g\!\to\!γ+γ+ q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!γ+ γ$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $φ^*_η$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599v1,human
The Light Dark Matter eXperiment,"Searching for dark matter (DM) at colliders is one of the biggest challenges in high-energy physics today. Significant efforts have been made to detect DM within the mass range of 1-10,000 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider and other experiments. However, the lower mass range of 0.001-1 GeV remains largely unexplored, despite strong theoretical motivation from thermal dark matter models in that mass range. The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is a proposed fixed-target experiment at SLAC's LCLS-II 8 GeV electron beamline, specifically designed for the direct production of sub-GeV dark matter. The experiment operates on the principle of detecting missing momentum and missing energy signatures. In this talk, we will present the experimental design of LDMX detector and discuss strategies for detecting dark matter. The talk will detail traditional discriminants-based methods using the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as a veto for Standard Model processes. Additionally, the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as boosted decision trees and graph neural networks, for distinguishing signal from background will be discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10678v1,human
Jet quenching in out-of-equilibrium QCD matter,"We present the first study of jet substructure modifications during the bottom-up evolution that describes the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we study the bremsstrahlung radiation rate of soft gluons from a hard parton propagating through out-of-equilibrium QCD matter. The gluon spectrum is computed within the Improved Opacity Expansion, which accounts for both multiple soft and single hard momentum exchanges between the hard probe and the medium. The background evolution is obtained from effective kinetic theory simulations that determine the jet quenching parameter, which in turn controls the radiation rate. We compute the radiation rate for initially under- and over-occupied systems, as well as for an expanding system undergoing hydrodynamization, which typically represents the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. The results for these dynamical backgrounds are compared to static and thermally matched scenarios, allowing to gauge the importance of bulk expansion in the evolution of the jet cascade. Our findings show that the early stages of the bulk matter evolution in heavy-ion collisions leave a sizable imprint on the radiation pattern inside jets. These results establish a basis for incorporating pre-equilibrium dynamics into realistic descriptions of jet quenching and hard-probe evolution.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07519v1,human

Renormalization-Group Invariant Parity-Doublet Model for Nuclear and Neutron-Star Matter,"The Parity-Doublet Model (PDM) is a chirally invariant effective theory for strong-interaction matter involving nucleons and their opposite-parity partners in a parity-doubling framework. We introduce a multiplicatively renormalizable mean-field approach to include the baryonic vacuum contributions to the resulting grand-canonical potential in an explicitly renormalization-group invariant form. As an application, we evaluate the pertinent thermodynamics of two-flavor symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, focusing on the restoration of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at baryon densities and temperatures relevant for the astrophysics of neutron stars. Special attention is paid to the effect of the baryonic vacuum fluctuations on the evolution of chiral condensate with baryon density and temperature for specific choices of the chirally invariant baryon mass $m_0$ to demonstrate the importance of consistently including these vacuum fluctuations in the PDM.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07226v1,human
Bridging the divide: axion searches and axino phenomenology at colliders,"We discuss a phenomenological model extending the minimal supersymmetric standard model containing axions and their supersymmetric partner, the axino. In the supersymmetric DFSZ axion model, the axino has tree level couplings to the higgs sector. In the case where R-parity is conserved, collider experiments may be sensitive to displaced decays of heavier neutralino states into lighter, mostly axino states. We present a sensitivity analysis using a model in which mostly higgsino next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle states decay into a mostly axino lightest supersymmetric particle. The model is studied using Monte Carlo simulation produced using MadGraph and estimates of experimental sensitivities to the model, including detector simulation and kinematic selections, are evaluated using the MadAnalysis5 framework. For a higgsino mass below 1 TeV, the axion decay constant below $f_a < 10^{11}$ GeV can be effectively probed by the Large Hadron Collider with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. This work demonstrates that supersymmetric DFSZ axion models can be studied with existing collider experiments, offering complementary sensitivity to direct-detection and astrophysical searches and paving the way for broader exploration of supersymmetric axion scenarios.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07224v1,human
Neural Fake Factor Estimation Using Data-Based Inference,"In a high-energy physics data analysis, the term ""fake"" backgrounds refers to events that would formally not satisfy the (signal) process selection criteria, but are accepted nonetheless due to mis-reconstructed particles. This can occur, e.g., when leptons from secondary decays are incorrectly identified as originating from the hard-scatter interaction point (known as non-prompt leptons), or when other physics objects, such as hadronic jets, are mistakenly reconstructed as leptons (resulting in mis-identified leptons). These fake leptons are usually estimated using data-driven techniques, one of the most common being the Fake Factor method. This method relies on predicting the fake lepton contribution by reweighting data events, using a scale factor (i.e. fake factor) function. Traditionally, fake factors have been estimated by histogramming and computing the ratio of two data distributions, typically as functions of a few relevant physics variables such as the transverse momentum $p_\text{T}$ and pseudorapidity $η$. In this work, we introduce a novel approach of fake factor calculation, based on density ratio estimation using neural networks trained directly on data in a higher-dimensional feature space. We show that our method enables the computation of a continuous, unbinned fake factor on a per event basis, offering a more flexible, precise, and higher-dimensional alternative to the conventional method, making it applicable to a wide range of analyses. A simple LHC open data analysis we implemented confirms the feasibility of the method and demonstrates that the ML-based fake factor provides smoother, more stable estimates across the phase space than traditional methods, reducing binning artifacts and improving extrapolation to signal regions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06972v1,human
Ultracold neutron energy spectrum and storage properties from magnetically induced spin depolarization,"We present a novel method for extracting the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons from magnetically induced spin depolarization measurements using the n2EDM apparatus. This method is also sensitive to the storage properties of the materials used to trap ultracold neutrons, specifically, whether collisions are specular or diffuse. We highlight the sensitivity of this new technique by comparing the two different storage chambers of the n2EDM experiment. We validate the extraction by comparing to an independent measurement for how this energy spectrum is polarized through a magnetic-filter, and finally, we calculate the neutron center-of-mass offset, an important systematic effect for measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06884v1,human
Azimuthal Modulations in Photon-Induced Processes,"We review recent theoretical developments and experimental measurements of azimuthal modulations in photon-induced processes, covering both ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) and $e^+e^-$ colliders. The azimuthal asymmetries $\cos(nφ)$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) serve as precision diagnostics that probe the linear polarization of coherent photons, final-state soft radiation effects, and quantum interference phenomena at the femtometer scale. In UPCs, we discuss dilepton production, diffractive dijet and vector meson production, where theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with STAR, ALICE, and CMS measurements. The unique double-slit interference effect in nucleus-nucleus collisions plays a crucial role in describing experimental observations. At $e^+e^-$ colliders, $γγ\toππ$ azimuthal asymmetries enable the direct extraction of helicity amplitude phases, with important implications for hadronic light-by-light scattering and the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Azimuthal modulations establish a powerful tool for multi-dimensional nuclear imaging and precision QED/QCD tests.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06855v1,human
Analytical Inverse QCD Coupling Constant approach and its result for $α_s$,"We propose a model for the QCD running coupling constant based on the Analytical Inverse QCD Coupling Constant concept with an additional regularization in the low momentum region. Analyticity in the $q^2$-complex plane, where $q$ is the 4-momentum transfer, is imposed by methods of the Analytic Perturbation Theory. The model incorporates a peculiar low-momentum behavior for $α_s(q^2)$ as a divergence at $q^2=0$ to retrieve color confinement, without spoiling its correct high-momentum behavior. This was achieved by means of a two-parameter regularization function, for which we considered three possible analytic expressions. In fact, in the framework of the Analytic Perturbation Theory, $α_s(q^2)$ assumes a finite value for $q^2=0$, at all perturbative orders (\emph{infrared stability}), hence the infrared divergence can not be implemented. For this reason, we found it more straightforward to work with its reciprocal, namely $\varepsilon_s(q^2) = 1/α_s(q^2)$, imposing its vanishing at the origin of the $q^2$-complex plane via the multiplication of the aforementioned regularizing functions to the spectral density. Once the two free parameters of the regularization functions are settled by fitting to the experimental values of $α_s(q^2)$ at the momenta where these data are available and reliable, the model can reproduce the QCD running coupling constant at any other momentum transferred.} \\ \noindent \textbf{Keywords: }APT, Analytical Inverse QCD coupling constant ICC, regularization functions, $α_s(M_Z^2)$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06503v1,human
Flavored QCD axion and Modular invariance,"A four-dimensional effective model with $G_{\rm SM}\times SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times U(1)_X$ is proposed in string-derived supergravity framework, where $G_{\rm SM}$ is the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and $U(1)_X$ is gauged. We show $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$- and $U(1)_X$-mixed anomalies should vanish. Anomalies induced by K{ä}hler transformations match those from gaugino chiral rotations. When SM fermions transform nontrivially under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and with vanishing gaugino contributions, the anomaly-free conditions are powerful enough to determine the quark and lepton flavor structures, set scales for $U(1)_X$ breaking, and ensure the strong CP phase remains unmodified. While the Green-Schwarz coefficient $δ^{\rm GS}_X$ is generically non-zero, vanishing $U(1)_X$ anomalies cause gauge boson decoupling and $δ^{\rm GS}_X\rightarrow 0$, yielding a massless global $U(1)_X$ without a Nambu-Goldstone mode. We show that the modulus vacuum expectation value stabilizes near $\langleτ\rangle \approx i$, where exact $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ($T$-duality) is spontaneously broken, removing residual modular symmetry. The framework predicts seesaw-generated neutrino masses and flavored axion properties, with all Yukawa coefficients constrained to unit-magnitude complex numbers. Our model reproduces current quark and lepton data, predicts an axion mass $m_a=1.82\times10^{-4}$ eV and photon coupling $|g_{aγγ}|=1.75\times10^{-14}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and unlike the ordinary case, suppresses flavor-violating axion couplings to $s,d$ quarks and $μ,e$ leptons to $\mathcal{O}(λ^4)$ (with $λ$ the Cabibbo angle). It also yields normal neutrino mass hierarchy consistent with oscillation data, $0νββ$-decay rate, and cosmological and astrophysical measurements.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06355v1,human
Natural Realization of Tens-of-GeV Dark Matter in the GNMSSM,"This study presents a comparative analysis of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ($Z_3$-NMSSM), and the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (GNMSSM), incorporating constraints from dark matter (DM) relic density, the LUX-ZEPLIN 2024 experiment (LZ 2024), Higgs data, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results suggest that, among the three frameworks, only GNMSSM can naturally accommodate for light DM with a mass below $100~{\rm GeV}$. As such, the viable supersymmetry candidate is primarily Singlino-like. One key advantage of the GNMSSM is the effective decoupling between interactions that establish the relic density and those that control direct detection, allowing the model to satisfy all current experimental bounds simultaneously. We further explore two characteristic mass hierarchies in the GNMSSM parameter space, each exhibiting distinct phenomenological behaviors. The first hierarchy, $\tilde{S} < \tilde{B} < \tilde{H}$ (Singlino--Bino--Higgsino), involves a relatively light Bino and allows the Higgsino mass parameter, $μ_{\rm tot}$, to be as low as about $200~{\rm GeV}$, naturally yielding light DM at tens of GeV. The dominant annihilation channels are then $\tildeχ_1^0\tildeχ_1^0 \to A_sA_s$ in the $h_1$ scenario and $\tildeχ_1^0\tildeχ_1^0 \to h_sA_s$ in the $h_2$ scenario, where $h_s$ and $A_s$ denote singlet-dominated CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons, respectively. The second hierarchy, $\tilde{S} < \tilde{H} < \tilde{B}$, corresponds to a heavy Bino. In this case, although the DM phenomenology remains qualitatively similar, LHC constraints require $μ_{\rm tot} \gtrsim 900~{\rm GeV}$, implying a significant degree of fine-tuning in reproducing the $Z$-boson mass.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06329v1,human
RG evolution and effect of intermediate new-physics on $ΔB=1$ four-fermion operators,"Motivated by the stringent experimental bounds on proton lifetime and the need for precise low-energy predictions, there has been renewed interest in the renormalization group (RG) evolution of Wilson coefficients for baryon number violating (BNV) operators and their characteristic new-physics scales. In this work, we analyze the RG running of dimension-six four-fermion operators in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme that mediate nucleon decay channels such as $p \to e^+ π^0$, while systematically accounting for the impact of baryon number conserving (BNC) new-physics that can enter the theory at an intermediate scale as higher-dimensional effective field theory operator. These BNC operators mix with BNV ones at 1-loop and alter the RG flow. The running is performed from the electroweak scale up to representative intermediate scales of $10^4~\text{GeV}$, $10^6~\text{GeV}$, and $10^9~\text{GeV}$, corresponding to possible thresholds for new BNC degrees of freedom. Comparing the RG evolved coefficients with current experimental bounds on nucleon decay lifetimes, we find that the inclusion of BNC-BNV mixing, dominated by top quark loops, can significantly lower the effective proton decay scale. A Python package is provided to facilitate the RG evolution of nucleon-decay Wilson coefficients, allowing for the inclusion of generic BNC effects.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06106v1,human
Universal modified function in conjunction with the short range correlation effect to extract the nuclear $xF_3^A$ structure function,"Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are comprehensive and not reliant on the process. They are affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. As a recent approach, in order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), the nucleon pair PDFs are utilized to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which are confined to a nucleus. Nucleon pair PDFs stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation which is called short range correlation (SRC) and are proportional to common nucleon PDFs. In this regard a modified universal function is constructed which provides a test for SRC in (neutrino)-nucleus scattering. In fact we can show that the modification of the structure function of nucleons bound in atomic nuclei (known as the EMC effect) are consistently accounted for within the frame work of a universal modification of nucleons in SRC pairs. In this article, based on the strategy which was introduced in Ref.\cite{nature}, we are investigating to find the universality behaviour for the ratio of nonsinglet $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function. The numerical calculations performed within the CTEQ framework confirm the universality feature of the concerned ratio, as has been established for the ratio of the structure function $F^A_2$ in Ref. \cite{nature}. Following that we reformulate the $R_{EMC}$ nuclear weight function which relates the free and bound structure function in terms of modified universal function. It makes us a possibility to achieve $R_{EMC}$ and finally $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function for each nucleus only by considering the specified feature of nucleus.The results are compared with the nuclear $xF_3$ structure function which are computing from bound PDFs, based on some parameterizations models.

Phenomenology of the Minimal Scale Invariant Two-Higgs-Doublet Model,"We perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the Scale Invariant Two Higgs Doublet Model (\textit{SI2HDM})~\cite{Lee:2012jn}. In this framework, the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered radiatively, and the entire scalar mass spectrum, including that of the $125$ \textrm{GeV} Higgs boson, is generated at the one loop level. After imposing stringent theoretical and experimental constraints, a highly constrained viable parameter space is identified, where the SM-like Higgs mass is purely radiative. The model predicts substantial suppression in the triple Higgs couplings and the di-Higgs production cross section at the LHC13, which can be reduced by up to $45.5~\%$ compared to the Standard Model prediction.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06049v1,human
An anomaly-free leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ completion of the Standard Model,"We develop a minimal and fully anomaly-free realization of a universal leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ gauge symmetry, under which all Standard-Model leptons carry a common charge while quarks remain neutral. Gauge consistency is restored by introducing one vectorlike lepton family and singlet scalars whose vacuum expectation values both break $U(1)'_{\ell}$ and generate masses for the new gauge boson $Z_{\ell}$ and the heavy leptons.   We derive compact anomaly-cancellation conditions, closed-form $Z_{\ell}$ couplings and decay widths, and the structure of gauge--kinetic mixing, including the trace condition $\mathrm{Tr}(YQ')=0$ that suppresses radiative mixing. The setup naturally embeds a type-I seesaw for neutrino masses and provides a stable singlet field as a minimal dark-matter candidate. Collider and precision constraints are expressed analytically over the full parameter space, covering pure leptophilic production, small-mixing hadron colliders, and the contact-interaction limit $M_{Z_{\ell}}\!\gg\!\sqrt{s}$.   The model therefore provides a single, internally consistent benchmark that unifies gauge, scalar, Yukawa, neutrino, and dark-matter sectors, and is directly suited for global data recasts and targeted searches at future lepton and hadron colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05976v1,human

In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $Λ, Σ$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm γ\to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- γ\to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs.

Discovery Prospects for a Leptophilic Gauge Boson $Z_\ell$ at CEPC and ILC,"We investigate the discovery prospects of a leptophilic gauge boson Z_l at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, focusing on a comparative study of the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). This state can arise from an additional U(1)'_l gauge symmetry under which quarks are neutral and all leptons have a universal charge, motivated by neutrino oscillations and physics beyond the Standard Model. As a clean benchmark we study $e^+e^- \to μ^+μ^-$ including realistic initial state radiation (ISR) and beamstrahlung. We find that CEPC at sqrt(s)=240 GeV can probe couplings down to $g_l \sim 10^{-3}$ for $Z_l$ masses up to about 220 GeV, while the ILC extends the sensitivity to heavier states in the multi-hundred GeV range through its higher sqrt(s) stages.

Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again,"Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |Φ|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |Φ|^2 \ln \left( |Φ|^2/Λ^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $Λ$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity   $ξ|Φ|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $λ|Φ|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $ξ\approx 1$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799v1,human

New Avenues for $|ΔB|$ = 2 Processes Beyond Neutron-Antineutron Oscillations,"We explore baryon-number-violating ($|ΔB| = 2$) processes beyond the well-known neutron-antineutron ($n - \bar{n}$) oscillations, focusing on the $Λ- \bar Λ$ system. The presence of a strange quark in the $Λ$ baryon introduces a new set of six-quark operators roughly of the form $(uds)^2$, which are different from the $(udd)^2$ operators responsible for $n - \bar{n}$ oscillations. Using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we classify all dimension-9 operators that cause $|ΔB|=2$ transitions and study their UV completions mediated by exotic scalar fields with trilinear interactions. We demonstrate that in these models, $Λ- \bar Λ$ oscillations can occur at tree level, with $n - \bar{n}$ mixing potentially appearing at higher loop levels. We employ a chiral effective theory to constrain the effective mass mixing $δm_Λ$, deriving bounds from current experimental limits on $n - \bar{n}$ oscillations and dinucleon decays such as $p \,p \to K^+ K^+$. These bounds indicate that $Λ- \barΛ$ oscillations probe a complementary parameter space, sensitive to baryon-number violation at scales up to $10^2-10^3$ TeV.

Probing Dark Energy Microphysics with kSZ Tomography,"The accelerated expansion of the Universe is well established by geometric probes, yet its physical origin remains poorly understood. Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables -- supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background -- which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05653v1,human
Flavor blocking of dark matter thermalization in neutron stars,"Neutron stars (NSs) provide exceptional laboratories for probing dark matter (DM) interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial experiments. We investigate a scenario in which DM couples to electrons and muons through a lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) coupling. In the strong gravitational field of NSs, infalling DM attains semi-relativistic velocities that activate inelastic transitions $χe \leftrightarrow χμ$, leading to efficient energy deposition through scattering and annihilation. We show that this latter heating mechanism remains efficient even for $p$-wave suppressed annihilations. This is due to \textsl{flavor blocking} of DM thermalization with the NS, as LFV interactions become forbidden for low kinetic energies of $χ$. The resulting DM-induced heating can sustain NS surface temperatures of $T_s \gtrsim 2 \times 10^3~\mathrm{K}$, providing an observable signature for future infrared searches. This establishes NS heating as a powerful probe of flavor-violating DM portals, capable of probing thermal targets beyond the reach of direct, indirect, and accelerator-based searches, as we illustrate for the axion-like particle (ALP) mediator.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05651v2,human
The $Zα^2$ correction to superallowed beta decays in effective field theory and implications for $|V_{ud}|$,"Superallowed ($0^+\rightarrow0^+$) beta decays currently provide the most precise extraction of quark mixing in the Standard Model. Their interpretation as a measurement of $|V_{ud}|$ relies on a reliable first-principles computation of QED radiative corrections expressed as a series in $Zα$ and $α$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent result for two-loop, $O(Zα^2)$, long-distance radiative corrections where the nuclei are treated as heavy point-like particles.   We use renormalization group analysis to obtain new results at $O(Zα^3)$ for the coefficient of double-logarithms in the ratio of the maximal beta energy to the inverse nuclear size, $\Em/R^{-1}$. We use the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem to obtain new results at $O(Z^2α^3)$ for the coefficient of logarithms in the ratio of maximal beta energy to the electron mass, $\log(2\Em/\me)$. We identify a structure-dependent, and therefore short-distance, contribution to the traditional $Zα^2$ correction that should be revisited.. We provide the first comprehensive update to the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the impact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in the long-distance corrections are $2.5\times$ larger than past estimates of their uncertainty, $1.5\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the combined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated systematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05446v1,human
D-Dimensional Modular Assembly of Higher-Derivative Four-Point Contact Amplitudes Involving Fermions,"We present a novel robust framework for systematically constructing D-dimensional four-point higher-derivative contact amplitudes. Our modular block (""LEGO""-like) approach builds amplitudes directly from manifestly gauge-invariant kinematic blocks, color-weight factors, and scalar Mandelstam polynomials. Symmetries (Bose/Fermi) are imposed algebraically, acting as filters on combinations of compatible pieces. This framework operates entirely in D dimensions, naturally incorporating evanescent operators crucial for loop-level consistency. Scaling to arbitrary mass dimension is achieved in a highly controlled manner using permutation-invariant scalar polynomials, avoiding combinatorial explosion. A key feature is its manifest compatibility with the double-copy program, allowing the systematic generation of operator towers not only for gauge theories but also for gravity and other theories within the double-copy web.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05441v1,human
"Quantum Gravity, de Sitter Space, and Normalizability","We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $Λ$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of quantum gravity in de Sitter space.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05417v1,human
Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering Cross Sections at Medium Energies,"The weak interactions of neutrinos with other Standard Model particles are well described within the Standard Model of particle physics. However, modern accelerator-based neutrino experiments employ nuclei as targets, where neutrinos interact with bound nucleons, turning a seemingly simple electroweak process into a complex many-body problem in nuclear physics. At the time of writing this Encyclopedia of Particle Physics chapter, neutrino-nucleus interactions remain one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in accelerator-based neutrino oscillation measurements.   This chapter provides a pedagogical overview of neutrino interactions with nuclei in the medium-energy regime, spanning a few hundred MeV to several GeV. It introduces the fundamental electroweak formalism, outlines the dominant interaction mechanisms - including quasielastic scattering, resonance production, and deep inelastic scattering - and discusses how nuclear effects such as Fermi motion, nucleon-nucleon correlations, meson-exchange currents, and final-state interactions modify observable cross sections. The chapter also presents a brief survey of the foundational and most widely used theoretical models for neutrino-nucleus cross sections, together with an overview of current and upcoming accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments that are shaping the field.   Rather than targeting experts, this chapter serves as a primer for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career researchers entering the field. It provides a concise foundation for understanding neutrino-nucleus scattering, its relevance to oscillation experiments, and its broader connections to both particle and nuclear physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05413v1,human
Opportunities for Imaging Light Nuclei with a Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider,"The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will address several outstanding puzzles in modern nuclear physics. Key questions, such as the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and the origin of their mass and spin, can be explored through high-energy electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($θ\sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05638v1,human
Physics-informed neural network (PINN) modeling of charged particle multiplicity using the two-component framework in heavy-ion collisions: A comparison with data-driven neural networks,"In this study, we employ a conventional deep neural network (NN) framework integrated with physics-based constraints to predict charged hadron multiplicity ($N_{\text{ch}}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The goal is to assess the performance of a purely data-driven deep neural network in comparison to a physics-informed neural network (PINN). To accomplish this, we have taken data generated from the HYDJET++ model for testing and training purposes. We train our neural network frameworks using the data of one million individual $^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}+^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}$ collision events. Our PINN model successfully extracts the hard-scattering fraction ($x$) by learning its underlying relation from the event data. For further testing and comparison with the conventional NN, we take data of $^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}+^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}$ (isobar of Zr) and $^{197}_{79}\text{Au}+^{197}_{79}\text{Au}$ collisions using the same simulation model. We found that the NN model needs more time to train with physics. However, once trained, the PINN model is capable of accurately predicting data that it has not encountered during training, such as Au+Au collision results. Especially in a region of sparse data corresponding to high $N_{\text{ch}}$ in our study, PINN has a clear advantage over a simple NN.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05186v1,human
Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Energies Using LHAASO Observations of GRB221009A via DisCan Algorithm,"The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan) algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV. Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties from both energy resolution and temporal binning. We derive $95\%$ confidence level lower limits on the LIV energy scale of $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{19}~\text{GeV}>21.1$ (13.8) for the first-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario, and $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{11}~\text{GeV}> 14.9$ (13.7) for the second-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05062v1,human
Scalar Resonances near 650 and 95 GeV in the GNMSSM with Correct Dark Matter Relic Abundance,"Recent CMS analyses report an excess in the diphoton-plus-$b \bar{b}$ channel, indicative of a heavy resonance around 650 GeV decaying into a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson and a lighter scalar near 95 GeV. The case for a 95 GeV state is further supported by diphoton excesses observed by both CMS and ATLAS, as well as a $b\bar{b}$ excess previously observed at the Large Electron-Position collider. This study present a unified interpretation of these anomalies within the framework of the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model that naturally accommodates a light singlet-dominated $CP$-even scalar boson near 95 GeV and an heavier doublet-like scalar boson near 650 GeV. Through a comprehensive scan of the parameter space, we demonstrate that the model can explain these excesses at $2σ$ level while satisfying constraints from the dark matter relic density, direct detection experiments, the properties of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, $B$-physics observables, and searches for electroweakinos at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The interpretation features a Bino-dominated lightest neutralino as the dark matter candidate, whose relic abundance is achieved primarily via $A_s$ funnel annihilation or coannihilation with $\tilde{S}$-like $\tildeχ^0_2$s into $h_sA_H$ final states. Our findings provide clear predictions for testing this scenario at the high-luminosity LHC and future colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04968v1,human
Low-reheating scenario in dark Higgs inflation and its impact on dark photon dark matter production,"We investigate dark matter (DM) phenomenology and cosmic inflation within a unified framework based on a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM). The associated dark gauge boson, namely the dark photon, serves as a viable DM candidate, which we call dark photon dark matter (DPDM), whilst the dark Higgs field drives inflation. We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM production occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution of the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending on the dark gauge coupling strength. For FIMP-type DM, the entropy dilution allows for stronger couplings whilst maintaining the correct relic abundance, potentially bringing these candidates within the reach of current and near-future detection experiments. Similarly, WIMP-type DM can be realised with weaker couplings. We perform a comprehensive parameter scan incorporating constraints from collider data, DM direct and indirect detection experiments, and cosmological observations. Taking quantum corrections and running of the couplings into account, we demonstrate that dark Higgs inflation yields predictions for the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that are consistent with the Planck, BICEP/Keck, and ACT data. The nonminimal coupling of the dark Higgs inflaton field to gravity is shown to be much smaller than in the case of the SM Higgs inflation scenario, avoiding unitarity concerns. We show that reheating temperatures as low as 1 GeV and 1 MeV can be achieved through the decay and scattering processes of the inflaton, respectively, with the latter allowing for larger Higgs mixing angles and enhanced detection prospects. Our results establish that this minimal extension successfully unifies DM physics with inflationary cosmology.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04933v1,human
Are Subleading Effects Really Subleading? $B$-Meson Decays in Mesogenesis,"We calculate inclusive $B$-meson decay rates in the Mesogenesis framework, a model explaining baryogenesis and the existence of dark matter, using the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE), up to the dimension-six two-quark Darwin term. By systematically studying the power-suppressed contributions, we identify regions of parameter space where subleading terms exceed the leading contribution, i.e., the free $b$-quark decay, highlighting the limits of the HQE in this BSM scenario. This behavior is reminiscent of the Standard Model only under artificially heavy charm masses, and can be used to study the HQE close to its breakdown. We further update the lower bounds on the exclusive decay mode $B^+ \to p^+ ψ$ by incorporating the fully HQE-corrected inclusive width in the ratio $Γ_{\mathrm{excl}}/Γ_{\mathrm{incl}}$. Extending the analysis from total decay rates to the lifetime ratio $τ(B_s)/τ(B_d)$, we find no additional constraints on the couplings beyond existing collider bounds, consistent with analogous results for $τ(B^+)/τ(B_d)$. We further compare the sensitivity of both lifetime ratios.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04858v1,human
Millicharged Particle Production in Pulsars via the Schwinger Effect,Low mass particles with small electric charges can be produced abundantly in large electric fields via the Schwinger effect. We study the production rate of such particles inside the polar gap of nearby pulsars. After production they are accelerated above MeV energies by the local electric fields. These pulsar-produced millicharged particles can be detected at Earth in low-threshold dark matter direct detection experiments. We find that the current XENONnT data constrains millicharged particles produced in the Crab pulsar to have charges less than $O(10^{-6})$ for sub-eV masses.,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04763v1,human

"NuFast-Earth: Efficient Atmospheric, Solar, and Supernova Neutrino Propagation Through the Earth","Algorithms for computing neutrino oscillation probabilities in sharply varying matter potentials such as the Earth are becoming increasingly important. As the next generation of experiments, DUNE and HyperK as well as the IceCube upgrade and KM3NeT, come online, the computational cost for atmospheric and solar neutrinos will continue to increase. To address these issues, we expand upon our previous algorithm for long-baseline calculations to efficiently handle probabilities through the Earth for atmospheric, nighttime solar, and supernova neutrinos. The algorithm is fast, flexible, and accurate. It can handle arbitrary Earth models with two different schemes for varying density profiles. We also provide a c++ implementation of the code called NuFast-Earth along with a detailed user manual. The code intelligently keeps track of repeated calculations and only recalculates what is needed on each successive call which can also help provide significant speed-ups.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04735v1,human
Electroweak phase transition enhanced by a CP-violating dark sector,"Within a well-motivated 3-Higgs doublet model, in which the extended dark sector accommodates CP violation, we analyse the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) at one- and two-loop order.

The size of the quark-gluon plasma in ultracentral collisions: impact of initial density fluctuations on the average transverse momentum,"Recent experiments have shown that the mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T\rangle$ of outgoing particles increases as a function of the particle multiplicity in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies. This increase was originally predicted on the basis of simulations where the multiplicity increase occurred at constant volume, so that it implied a larger density and temperature. However, recent state-of-the-art simulations have shown that, for some models of initial condition, the volume may vary with the multiplicity in ultracentral collisions. We elucidate this effect by analytically relating the variation of the volume to the radial distribution of the one- and two-point functions of the fluctuating density field. We show that the volume variation is small if the total entropy of the ultracentral collisions scales with the mass number of the colliding isotopes. We argue that probing detailed transverse distributions of initial-state fluctuations through the ultracentral $\langle p_T\rangle$ has nontrivial implications for models of nuclear structure and of the pre-equilibrium stages.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04605v1,human
Constraining the four-light quark operators in the SMEFT with multijet and VBF processes at linear level,"We investigate how the interference of the SM with ten four-light quark operators in the SMEFT can be constrained thanks to multijet and $Z,W,γ$ VBF production in association with jets. The differential distributions for each process are generated at LO for different jet multiplicities, that are then merged and showered. We check which observables provide better bounds on the Wilson coefficients, and what directions in the ten-dimensional coefficient space they are able to probe. We discuss the relevance of the quadratic contributions with respect to the linear terms.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04517v2,human
Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections,"We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$ (kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992 MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes $γγ\to π^0 π^0$ or $γγ\to π^0 η$. The latter process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $σ(γγ\to π^0 η) / σ(γγ\to π^0 π^0) \approx 9$. Due to the short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim 0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the available experimental data is obtained.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392v1,human
Gauge invariance from quantum information principles,"Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness, sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability. This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge invariance in fundamental physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04358v1,human
Emerging Narrow Resonance at 152 GeV,"The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC completed the Standard Model (SM), yet the possibility of additional scalars remains open, provided their contributions to electroweak symmetry breaking are sufficiently small. Recent analyses of LHC data have revealed statistically significant anomalies in multi-lepton final states - events characterized by multiple leptons, missing transverse energy, and ($b$-)jets. These anomalies provide intriguing hints of physics beyond the SM. In this work, we present the signature of growing excesses for a new scalar resonance with a mass of $152 \pm 1$ GeV, observed in the $γγ$, $Zγ$, and $WW$ channels. The combined global significance reaches a level that points toward the growing signature of this resonance. The findings align with a simplified model in which a heavy scalar boson decays into two lighter scalars, thus providing a consistent framework explaining the observed multi-lepton anomalies.   These results significantly advance the search for new scalar bosons at the electroweak scale. Future investigations, including precision studies with upcoming HL-LHC data, will be crucial for confirming the nature of this resonance and exploring its implications for extending the SM.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04335v2,human

The results are compared with H1 data and extended to high inelasticity. We also examine the ratio $\frac{σ_{r}}{F_{2}}(\frac{Q^2}{s}, Q^2)$ obtained at a fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$, comparing them with both the HERA data and the color dipole model bounds.

"Reply to ""Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem""","The conservation of $CP$ in QCD has been shown to follow from a careful treatment of the path integral and canonical quantization in arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747. Here, we refute the critique of these results put forth in arXiv:2510.18951. First, using the quantum rotor as an analogue of QCD, it is argued in arXiv:2510.18951 that the topological susceptibility vanishes when using the limiting procedure of arXiv:2001.07152. When translated to QCD, this would contradict the observed $η^\prime$-mass. We show that this is not the case because the susceptibility is defined from the vacuum correlator of the topological charge density, which for the rotor is just fixed by the canonical commutation relation. The latter does not depend on the disputed order of limits. Second, it is suggested in arXiv:2510.18951 that $CP$ violation in QCD can be established by considering the low-energy effective theory alone. We show that here the argument relies on assuming from the start choices of couplings that lead to $CP$ violation but are not of the most general form allowed by spurion analysis. No valid reason is given for why allowed choices leading to $CP$ conservation, that match the computation of ultraviolet correlators as shown in arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747, would be inconsistent.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04216v1,human
Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density,"Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204v2,human
Two-exponential decay of Acridine Orange,"In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical predictions. Using two distinct photon detectors, we find that the data are well described by a sum of two exponential functions with lifetimes $τ_1 = 1.7331 \pm 0.001$ ns and $τ_2 = 5.948 \pm 0.012$ ns, in agreement with values reported in the literature.

Predictive one-zero with vanishing sub-trace texture in neutrino mass matrix in light of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay,"In this work, we investigate a predictive class of neutrino mass matrices characterized by one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace within the framework of the scotogenic model, wherein neutrino masses, dark matter, and neutrinoless double beta decay are intrinsically correlated. We analyze twelve viable texture structures -- namely $B_{1,4,5}$, $C_{1,2,\ldots,5}$, $D_{4,5}$, and $F_{5,6}$ -- and examine their implications for the effective Majorana mass $(|M_{ee}|)$ governing neutrinoless double beta decay $(0νββ)$. Remarkably, all non-zero entries of the neutrino mass matrix can be parametrized in terms of this effective Majorana mass, establishing a direct theoretical link between low-energy observables and high-scale parameters of the model. Among the twelve textures, eleven predict dark matter masses of order TeV and yield correlated bounds on $|M_{ee}|$ -- making them testable in current and forthcoming $0νββ$ experiments -- while the textures $D_4$ and $F_{5,6}$ exhibit comparatively weaker correlations. In contrast, the texture $C_5$ is excluded due to its requirement of unrealistically large Yukawa couplings and its inability to realize dark matter in the TeV regime. Our analysis thus identifies a subset of predictive neutrino mass textures that consistently relate dark matter phenomenology and neutrinoless double beta decay observables within the scotogenic paradigm.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04045v2,human
Soft-contribution to thermal photon emission from chiral QCD medium,We evaluate the thermal photon emission rate from a chirally asymmetric quark gluon plasma using the Hard Thermal Loop approximation. The quasiparticle and plasmino modes prevalent at finite temperature split into L and R-modes in the presence of chiral imbalance and are found to disperse differently acquiring different thermal masses. The soft contribution to the thermal photon emission rate obtained from the retarded self-energy is found to contain additional terms proportional to the square of the quark and chiral chemical potentials which is found to cause an enhancement to thermal photon emission in the presence of chiral imbalance.,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04034v1,human
Validating a Machine Learning Approach to Identify Quenched Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using \textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape, which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish true quenching features.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04005v1,human
Characterizing the initial state of hydrodynamics in pp and pA collisions,"The observation of seeming hydrodynamic-like behavior in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions presents us with the conceptual problem of how the initial state of such a hydrodynamic evolution should be characterized. This is an issue because, while nuclei can reasonably be approximated as ``large'' systems w.r.t. the characteristic Fermi momentum of their constituents, this is no longer true for nucleons. Hence, one would need to match a ``quantum'' theory, whose observables are described via highly non-commuting operators, to a ``classical'' hydrodynamics. Operationally assuming a ``fast'' thermalization, we survey what kind of object is best suited to such a matching condition. We show that it cannot be any of the objects usually associated with ``the 3D structure of the nucleon'' but rather a measure associated with entanglement entropy.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03851v1,human
Primordial Dirac Leptogenesis,"We present a novel realization of Dirac leptogenesis based on the post-inflationary reheating phase of the early universe. An asymmetry generated within the scalar sector via CP-violating and out-of-equilibrium inflaton decays is transferred to chiral neutrinos through Yukawa interactions and then to baryons via electroweak sphalerons. We describe in detail a minimal realization of this mechanism that naturally accommodates small neutrino Yukawa couplings and results in contributions to the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, testable in upcoming cosmological observations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03794v1,human
Light new physics and the $τ$ lepton dipole moments,"Testing New-Physics (NP) scenarios that couple predominantly to the third generation is notoriously difficult experimentally, as exemplified by comparing limits for the $τ$ lepton dipole moments to those of electron and muon. In this case, extracting limits from processes such as $e^+e^-\toτ^+τ^-$ often relies on effective-field-theory (EFT) arguments, which allows for model-independent statements, but only applies if the NP scale is sufficiently large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this work we offer a comprehensive analysis of light NP contributions to the $τ$ dipole moments, providing a detailed account of the interpretation of asymmetry measurements in $e^+e^-\toτ^+τ^-$ that are tailored towards the extraction of dipole moments, for the test cases of new light spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosons. Moreover, we study the decoupling to the EFT limit in these scenarios and discuss the complementarity to constraints from other related processes, such as production in $e^+e^-$ reactions. While covering a wide range of light NP scenarios, as specific case study we present a detailed discussion of a tauphilic gauge vector boson at Belle II.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03786v1,human
Direct Detection of Mechanism-Agnostic Fast-Moving Dark Matter,"We present a comprehensive framework for interpreting electron recoil signals induced by fast-moving dark matter (DM), applicable across a wide range of theoretically motivated models. Amid both null results in conventional weakly interacting massive particle searches and growing interest in alternative DM scenarios, we focus on (semi-)relativistic DM components that can arise from mechanisms such as DM annihilation, decay, or cosmic-ray acceleration. These boosted DM candidates produce distinct experimental signatures that differ qualitatively from non-relativistic DM, necessitating a dedicated treatment. Our framework incorporates relativistic kinematics and atomic effects through ionization form factors, enabling accurate predictions of differential cross sections in both low- and high-energy regimes. We demonstrate how atomic effects become negligible at high recoil energies, validating the free-electron approximation in specific parameter regions. Furthermore, we highlight the complementarity between low-threshold direct detection experiments and high-threshold neutrino observatories in probing fast-moving DM across broad kinematic domains. This formalism provides a robust and model-independent foundation for interpreting current and future searches for relativistic DM.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03780v1,human
The Trace Anomaly at Neutron Star Centers: Minimum or Not?,"While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $φ= P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $Δ= 1/3 - φ$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $φ$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $φ$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $φ$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $φ$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $Δ$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714v1,human
Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors,"We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm Ω_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~μ{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03630v1,human
Impact of QCD Energy Evolution on Observables in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"We study how the inclusion of energy dependence as dictated by quantum chromodynamic (QCD) small-$x$ evolution equations affects key observables in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we incorporate JIMWLK evolution into the IP-Glasma framework, which serves as the initial condition for a simulation pipeline that includes viscous relativistic hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner. This approach enables a consistent modeling of highly energetic nuclei across varying Bjorken-$x$ values, which are relevant for different collision energies and rapidity regions. In comparison to the standard IP-Glasma setup without small-$x$ evolution, we observe pronounced changes in particle multiplicities and spectral distributions, especially in smaller systems and at the highest available energies. We further explore effects on anisotropic flow observables and correlations between mean transverse momentum and elliptic flow. Our findings underscore the critical role of nonlinear QCD evolution in accurately modeling the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, as well as its implications for extracting transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03588v1,human
Scalar molecules $η_{b}B_{c}^{-}$ and $η_{c}B_{c}^{+} $ with asymmetric quark contents,"The hadronic scalar molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with asymmetric quark contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c} \overline{b}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. Their masses and current couplings are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The obtained results show that they are strong-interaction unstable particles and transform to ordinary mesons' pairs. The molecule $\mathcal{M} _{b}$ dissociates through the process $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{b}}\to η_{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The decays $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow η_{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/ψB_{c}^{\ast +}$ are dominant modes for the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{c}$. The full decay widths of the molecules $\mathcal{ M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are estimated using these decay channels, as well as ones generated by the annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ and $c \overline{c}$ quarks in $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$, respectively. The QCD three-point sum rule method is employed to find partial widths all of these channels. This approach is required to evaluate the strong couplings at the molecule-meson-meson vertices under consideration. The mass $m=(15728 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $Γ[\mathcal{M}_b] =(93 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{b}$, and $ \widetilde{m}=(9712 \pm 72)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ[\mathcal{M}_c]=(70 \pm 10)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{c} $ offer valuable guidance for experimental searches at existing facilities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03541v1,human
Oscillon decay via parametric resonance: the case of three-point scalar interactions,"We investigate the decay dynamics of oscillons through interactions with an external scalar field. To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point interaction $g_3φχ^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external field $χ$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes. Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03501v1,human
Exploring the Discovery Reach for a 95 GeV Scalar in Future $e^+e^-$ Collisions,"The observed indications for a new scalar resonance with a mass around 95\,GeV, initially reported by LEP and supported by CMS and ATLAS in di-photon, $ττ$, and $W^+ W^-$ channels, motivate exploring its discovery potential at future electron-positron colliders. This study focuses on the production of the new scalar ($S$) via $e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZS $ with $Z \rightarrow μ^+ μ^- $ and $S \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ and optimizes the signal recognition using the recoil-mass method. By employing deep neural networks for signal-background discrimination, we demonstrate that a 95\,GeV scalar, mixing with the Standard Model Higgs by an angle of $\sim$0.1, can be observed with a 5$σ$ significance at $\sqrt{s}$ = 250\,GeV or 200\,GeV with 5~ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03479v1,human
CP asymmetry factor in decays at finite temperature,"We present in the conventional equilibrium approach to leptogenesis the complete leading order prediction for the CP asymmetry factor in finite-temperature decays involving Majorana neutrinos. As thermal effects are generally not negligible, the knowledge of the high temperature behavior of the underlying particle physics model, in particular that of mass generation, is required for reliable estimates of matter-antimatter asymmetry through the mechanism of leptogenesis. We present all necessary information needed to obtain the full one-loop evaluation for the thermal CP asymmetry factors for the processes $N_i\to φ+ L$ and $φ\to N_i+L$ at temperatures where they are kinematically allowed. We present a numerical comparison with previous formulae given in the literature.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03445v1,human
Correlated PQCD Analysis of the Semileptonic Decays $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\ell^-\barν_\ell$ and the Nonleptonic Decays $ \overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}π^-$,"We present a unified analysis of $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\ell^-\barν_\ell$ and $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}π^-$ decays using the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The $B \to D^{(*)}$ transition form factors are calculated at low $q^2$ and extrapolated to the high-$q^2$ region using the latest lattice QCD results via a model-independent $z$-expansion. This hybrid method provides a precise form factor description across the full kinematic range. We then predict the branching fractions and the lepton flavor universality ratios $R(D) = 0.336^{+0.014}_{-0.013}$ and $R(D^*) = 0.271^{+0.010}_{-0.010}$, which are consistent with the latest experimental averages. Furthermore, we perform a correlated study of the nonleptonic $ \overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}π^-$ decays, calculating both factorizable and nonfactorizable amplitudes. To reduce hadronic uncertainties, we introduce and calculate the differential ratio $R^{(*)}_{π/\ell}(q^2)$, defined between nonleptonic and semileptonic decay rates, providing a sensitive test of factorization and possible new physics effects. The predictions presented here can be directly tested in ongoing Belle II and LHCb experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03414v1,human
Stellar-like Galactic center excess challenges particle dark matter,"The Galactic Center (GC) is potentially hosting the largest indirect signal from particle dark matter (DM), which in many well-motivated models would produce gamma rays as their final states. However, this region has often been dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge. Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV. The robustness of our results is supported by tests on simulated data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03350v1,human
"Test of the GENIE neutrino event generator against ${}^{16}$O $(e,e'p)$ data: Reduced cross section","The reduced cross section of the semiexclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scat tering process irrespective of the type of interaction is determined mainly by bound nucleon momentum distribution in target and nucleon final state interaction with residual nucleus. These cross sections can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions and therefore are similar up to Coulomb c orrections for neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei. In this article we exploit this similarity and use data with precise kinematics and large statistics for semiexclusive electron scattering on oxygen target to test models employed in the GENIE neutrino event generator. We find that these models can not reproduce well the measured reduced cross sections in all allowed kinematic region and the GENIE event generator needs to better describe both the nuclear ground states and nucleon final state interaction. The approach presented in this paper provides a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03274v1,human
Quantum Error Correction-like Noise Mitigation for Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Sensors,"We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03253v1,human
Chiral symmetry breaking in accelerating and rotating frames,"We study chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in accelerating and rotating frames using low-energy effective models. By analyzing the chiral condensate in Rindler coordinates, we show that different renormalization schemes lead to distinct conclusions in accelerating frame: the scheme with subtracting divergences in Rindler vacuum supports an acceleration-independent critical temperatures, while the other scheme with subtracting divergences in Minkowski vacuum suggests enhanced critical temperature. We further investigate system with both rotation and acceleration. We find that the critical acceleration (see definition in Section V) for chiral symmetry restoration decreases with angular velocity, indicating cooperative effects from acceleration-induced thermalization and rotation-induced effective chemical potential.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03230v2,human
Filling the Gap: Hunting for Vector Bosons at the MUonE Experiment with Displaced Decay Signature,"The upcoming MUonE experiment aims to precisely measure the running of the fine structure constant via elastic muon-electron scattering, to shed light on the current tension in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In addition to its primary function as a precision experiment, MUonE also offers a unique testing ground to probe long-lived vector bosons. Such vector bosons can be produced via $μe \to μe V$ or $μN \to μN V$ scattering and decay into an electron/positron pair a few centimeters away from the interaction point. With its high-resolution tracking system and unique geometric design, MUonE is well-suited to reconstruct displaced vertices close to the target, allowing it to probe parameter space previously unattainable at colliders and longer-baseline beam dump experiments. We present a comprehensive study of the discovery potential of BSM vector boson mediators at the MUonE experiment. We show that MUonE can fill the long-standing gap in the parameter space of vector boson mediators with masses up to around 100 MeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03222v1,human
Impact of the $a_1(1260) π$ cascade contribution on $D^0 \to π^+ π^- \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays,"We revisit the Standard Model description of the recently measured rare decays $D^0\toπ^+π^-\ell^+\ell^-$. Because of the effectiveness of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism in charm flavour-changing neutral currents, those decays are driven by non-local insertions of four-quark operators. Following previous work, we consider the mediation of resonances both for the dipion and dilepton pairs. For the first time, we incorporate the effect of the cascade-type topology $D^0\to π^- a_1^+(1260)(\toπ^+ρ^0(\to\ell^+\ell^-))$, which manifests distinctly in the invariant-mass and angular distributions. We find that this partial amplitude comprises one of the largest contributions to the decay rate and obtain an unprecedented agreement of the Standard Model prediction with the available LHCb data. Finally, we compare to the available CLEO-c, LHCb, and BESIII amplitude analyses for the analogous four-body hadronic decays and find that similar values of the hadronic parameters of our model successfully describe the two classes of decays.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02775v1,human
Infrared divergences and the photon mass in QED,"The infrared properties of QED are investigated within the framework of the Dyson-Schwinger equations. Our study finds that, independently of the value of the coupling constant, requiring the photon self-energy to be finite for any momenta, combined with a smooth behavior for the photon-fermion vertex, is equivalent to state that the photon is massless and that the photon propagator diverges at low momenta as $1/k^2$. Furthermore, the Schwinger mechanism to generate, in a gauge invariant way, a photon mass is investigated and the form factors that can be at the origin of a possible photon mass are identified. For the Schwinger mechanism the link between the finiteness of the photon self-energy and the masslessness of the photon is lost. The infrared behavior of the fermion gap equation and the vertex equation are found to be infrared safe integral equations. Moreover, by studying chiral fermions within QED it is observed that the requirement of the finiteness of the photon self-energy translates into a fermion propagator that behaves as $\slashed{p}/p^4$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02666v1,human
A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores,"Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653v1,human
Model Parameter Reconstruction of Electroweak Phase Transition with TianQin and LISA: Insights from the Dimension-Six Model,"We investigate the capability of TianQin and LISA to reconstruct the model parameters in the Lagrangian of new physics scenarios that can generate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. Taking the dimension-six Higgs operator extension of the Standard Model as a representative scenario for a broad class of new physics models, we establish the mapping between the model parameter $Λ$ and the observable spectral features of the stochastic gravitational wave background. We begin by generating simulated data incorporating Time Delay Interferometry channel noise, astrophysical foregrounds, and signals from the dimensional-six model. The data are then compressed and optimized, followed by geometric parameter inference using both Fisher matrix analysis and Bayesian nested sampling with PolyChord, which efficiently handles high-dimensional, multimodal posterior distributions. Finally, machine learning techniques are employed to achieve precise reconstruction of the model parameter $Λ$. For benchmark points producing strong signals, parameter reconstruction with both TianQin and LISA yields relative uncertainties of approximately $20$--$30\%$ in the signal amplitude and sub-percent precision in the model parameter $Λ$. TianQin's sensitivity is limited to stronger signals within its optimal frequency band, whereas LISA can reconstruct parameters across a broader range of signal strengths. Our results demonstrate that reconstruction precision depends on signal strength, astrophysical foregrounds, and instrumental noise characteristics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02612v1,human
Progress on Constraining the Strange Quark Contribution to the Nucleon Spin,"We report on a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Knowledge of the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor, $G_A^s(Q^2)$, at low $Q^2$ will reveal the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin, as $G_A^s(Q^2=0)=Δs$. Previous fits [1,2] of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2<0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed; a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model, the SuperScaling Approximation (SuSA) model, and a spectral function (SF) model [3]. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE [4].

Searches for heavy neutrinos at 3 TeV CLIC in fat jet final states,"The type-I seesaw mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses via the introduction of heavy Majorana neutrinos (N), which also constitute a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model. In this work, we explore the production and detection prospects of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos ($m_N \gtrsim 1$ TeV) at a future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We focus on two distinct decay topologies: (i) $N \to \ell^\pm W^\mp$ with hadronic $W$ boson decay, leading to a final state with one charged lepton, a hadronic fat-jet $J_W$, and missing transverse energy ($1\ell + J_W + \slashed{E}_T$); and (ii) $N \to νh$ with subsequent Higgs decay $h \to b\bar{b}$, yielding a Higgs-tagged fat-jet $J_h$ and $\slashed{E}_T$. Based on comprehensive detector-level simulations and background analysis, we present both $2σ$ exclusion limits and $5σ$ discovery reaches in the $m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane. We further extract 95\% confidence level upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, and perform a detailed comparison with existing constraints from direct searches at future colliders and indirect global fits. Our findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV CLIC can improve the sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by about two orders of magnitude compared to the projected reaches of future hadron colliders, while remaining competitive with other CLIC search channels.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02557v1,human
Masses of Light Flavor Mesons using Bethe-Salpeter Approach,"This work employs the approach based on the Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the light meson spectrum. The Dyson-Schwinger equation of the quark propagator is truncated using the Maris-Tandy model for the dressed gluon propagator, which incorporates both the infrared enhancement and the perturbatively correct ultraviolet behavior. Additionally, for the dressed quark-gluon vertex, we apply its bare form and the Ball-Chiu model, which minimally satisfies the constraint imposed by the gauge symmetry through its Ward-Green-Takahashi identity. Consistent truncation of both Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations requires that axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity, arising from chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics, must not be violated. We utilize this identity as an additional constraint to truncate the Bethe-Salpeter equation and examine the impact of two choices of quark-gluon vertex, along with the application of the Maris-Tandy model on the light meson spectrum. To extract the masses of flavored and unflavored light mesons, we solve the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation using the Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation, which enables us to locate the poles of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude without requiring a numerical solution in the timelike region of momentum space. We find that truncations of the Bethe-Salpeter equation based on bare and Ball-Chiu vertices, coupled with the Maris-Tandy model, yield consistent results.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02550v1,human

Accurate nucleon iso-vector scalar and tensor charge at physical point,"We report a new high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge $g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending"" method which provides a high-accuracy stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can efficiently cancel the major excited state contamination, we can extract high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 of the $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which covers 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, and includes three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most accurate lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0258[79]_{\rm tot}(56)_{\rm stat} (24)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_χ(24)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm QCD} = 1.107[47]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_χ(18)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the systematic uncertainty from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations, excited state contamination and also renormalization.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02326v1,human
Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in SMEFT extended with a light scalar,"New light particles have received considerable attention in recent years. Baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decays involving such light particles are able to provide stringent constraints. They exhibit distinctive experimental signatures that merit thorough investigation. We systematically investigate BNV nucleon decay with a light scalar in an effective field theory framework. Within this framework, we set stringent bounds on BNV operators using available experimental data and predict the occurrence of several BNV three-body nucleon decays. We further study contributions to dinucleon to dilepton transitions in a nucleus mediated by the scalar, which complements single nucleon decay. Finally, we provide three ultraviolet-complete models that can generate different subsets of BNV operators in leading order.

"Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications","We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118v2,human
Ultra-relativistic freeze-out: a bridge from WIMPs to FIMPs,"We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d} \approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much greater than $m_ν$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying incompatibility with $Λ$CDM, we show that when the approximation of instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative, post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars, there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition occurs \textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during reheating can produce the correct relic density ($Ω_χh^2 = 0.12$) for DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02117v1,human
Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics,"The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056v1,human
Underground Production of Electromagnetic Dark States by MeV-scale Electron Beams and Detection with CCDs,"In this work we explore the possibility of new light fermionic particles with millicharge or electromagnetic form factor interactions and their underground production via an electron beam in the 100 MeV range and their subsequent detection using a CCD-sensor. We evaluate the S-matrix elements and the phase spaces for production analytically, and then calculate the corresponding cross sections numerically. For millicharged fermions this set-up could be able to probe a window in parameter space, yet unconstrained by direct detection experiments. The electric or magnetic dipole moment of a light fermion could feasibly be probed with enough beam time or an increased beam energy.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02023v1,human
SEAL - A Symmetry EncourAging Loss for High Energy Physics,"Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness, data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01982v1,human
Incoherent Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions,"In this paper, we present the first complete treatment of incoherent photon-initiated production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions, focussing on the dilepton and diphoton final states. In the former case we compare to the ATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match the data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too small to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the purely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new `quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate the incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be kinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production and issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again cannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The production mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production, and the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case, therefore remains unclear.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01980v1,human
The curious case of parabolic encounters: gravitational waves with linear & non-linear memory,"The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events. However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism. Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit (ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero memory.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01968v1,human
Gradient RG Flow in Scalar-Fermion QFTs,"The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows. Physical properties of CFTs obtained as solutions where the beta functions are not zero in the $\varepsilon$ expansion are discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01971v1,human
A short blanket for cosmology: the CMB lensing anomaly behind the preference for a negative neutrino mass,"Recent analyses combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) challenge particle physics constraints on the total neutrino mass, pointing to values smaller than the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments. To examine the impact of different CMB likelihoods from $\mathit{Planck}$, lensing potential measurements from $\mathit{Planck}$ and ACT, and BAO data from DESI, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter ($\sum \tilde{m}_ν$) which is allowed to take negative values. We investigate its correlation with two extra parameters capturing the impact of gravitational lensing on the CMB: one controlling the smoothing of the peaks of the temperature and polarization power spectra; one rescaling the lensing potential amplitude. In this configuration, we infer $\sum \tilde{m}_ν=-0.018^{+0.085}_{-0.089}~\text{eV}~(68\% ~\text{C.L.})$, which is fully consistent with the minimal value required by neutrino oscillation experiments. We attribute the apparent preference for negative neutrino masses to an excess of gravitational lensing detected by late-time cosmological probes compared to that inferred from $\mathit{Planck}$ CMB angular power spectra. We discuss implications in light of the DESI BAO measurements and the CMB lensing anomaly.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01967v1,human
Constraining memory-burdened primordial black holes with graviton-photon conversion and binary mergers,"The memory-burden effect stabilizes the evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) before its complete decay. This also suppresses the evaporation flux via the entropy factor to the $k$-th power and circumvents severely astrophysical and cosmological constraints, such that it opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter lighter than $10^{15}$ g which has entered the memory-burden phase in the present epoch. In this study, we propose two scenarios to probe PBHs in the earlier semiclassical phase that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. The first scenario considers gravitons, emitted semiclassically from PBHs, propagating across the recombination epoch, then the magnetic field in the cosmological filaments converts them into photons via the Gertsenshtein effect. The second scenario relies on the PBHs mergers today, reproducing young semiclassical black holes with unsuppressed evaporation. We perform computations of the extragalactic photon spectrum from PBHs emission according to these scenarios. The upper limits on the fractional abundance of PBH are obtained by comparing with the sensitivities of gamma-ray observations. The graviton-photon conversion scenario excludes the mass window $7.5\times 10^5\,{\rm g} \leq M_{\rm PBH}\leq 4.4\times 10^7\,{\rm g}$ with $f_{\rm PBH}\geq 1$ and $k=1$. Meanwhile, the merging scenario, which is insensitive on $k$, restricts PBH Dark Matter lighter than $2.2\times 10^{11}$ g.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01848v1,human
Avoiding Blindness in Baryon Number Violating Processes: Free-Beam and Intranuclear Paths to Neutron-Antineutron Transitions,"Experimental searches for neutron--antineutron ($n \rightarrow \bar n$) transitions can be considered via two approaches: conversion in free-neutron beams and intranuclear transformation leading to matter instability in large-mass detectors. Plans for next-generation searches make it timely to highlight the complementarity, necessity, and limitations of each method. Converting the bound neutron limit into one for free neutrons traditionally utilizes nucleus-specific estimates of the in-medium suppression of $n \rightarrow \bar n$, obtained within mean-field theory under a single-operator assumption. This paper highlights how this suppression can be scenario-dependent, which can lead to deviations from the standard approach that can span several orders of magnitude. A further goal of the paper is to point out the need for a broader phenomenology program for $n\rightarrow \bar{n}$ that is akin to those developed for electric dipole moments and other systems for which short-distance new physics must be studied in-medium.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01829v1,human
Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators,"We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818v1,human
Axionlike particle searches in short-baseline liquid scintillator neutrino detectors,"Short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments using large organic liquid scintillator detectors provide an experimentally rich environment for precise neutrino physics. Neutrino detection is done through inverse beta decay and relies on prompt and delayed signals, which enable powerful background discrimination. In addition to their neutrino program, they offer an ideal experimental environment for other physics searches. Here we discuss the case of axionlike particles (ALPs) produced by either Primakoff-like or Compton-like processes. Their detection relies on the corresponding inverse processes, axio-electric absorption and ALP decays to photon or electron pairs. Assuming experimental parameter values broadly representative of JUNO-TAO or CLOUD we show that scattering ALP processes involve a prompt photon signal component followed by a delayed photon signal about 5 ns after. We point out that if these signals can be resolved, this might allow for efficient ALP signal discrimination against radioactive background. Likewise, coincident events from ALP decays and scintillation light followed by Auger electrons from axio-electric absorption might as well allow for background discrimination. We determine sensitivities in both the nuclear and electron channels using as a benchmark case an experimental setup resembling that of the CLOUD or JUNO-TAO detectors. Our findings demonstrate that with efficient background discrimination these type of technology has the capability to test regions in parameter space not yet explored. In particular, the cosmological triangle can be fully tested and regions of MeV ALP masses with ALP-electron couplings of the order of $10^{-8}$ can be entirely explored.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01812v1,human
The double copy effective action: a quantum (chromodynamics) approach to space-time,"Conventional Lagrangian formulations of gauge and gravity theories emphasize compactness and off-shell symmetry. This often obscures the structure of on-shell physical observables. In this work, we present a constructive framework that elevates gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes to the defining data for quantum field theory actions, including effective field theories. Focusing on double-copy theories, we promote color-dual amplitude numerators to quantum operators. This enables the systematic identification of novel local operator content at each multiplicity and the construction of double-copy-compatible actions. By applying this framework to the well-established double-copy relationship between Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills theory, which holds for all-multiplicity tree-level amplitudes, we demonstrate a systematic path to constructing the operator expansion of $\sqrt{-g}R$ from factorized gauge-theory components. This clarifies how gravitational interactions can be understood as emerging from simpler gauge-theoretic structures at the action level. This formalism extends color-kinematics duality from amplitude data to operator constructions, naturally realizing the double copy at the level of actions and asymptotic quantum states. We illustrate the method with Yang-Mills theory, Einstein gravity, and its application to generating higher-derivative operators inspired by Z-theory and open superstring amplitudes. This work provides a concrete bridge between structured amplitudes and effective actions, offering a physically grounded alternative to traditional EFT basis-building. It reveals at the operator level deep structural connections between gauge theory and gravity (connections long recognized in scattering amplitudes) from fundamental interactions to their quantum state descriptions and higher-derivative extensions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01799v1,human
Form of axion in DFSZ models with $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry,"Form of axion state in the DFSZ model is determined by exacted diagonalizing of the mass mixing matrix of $CP$-odd sector. After applying $PQ$ mechanism to determine $PQ$ charges of particles of the model, these $PQ$ charges are used to define the general form of axion. Both of these two methods give consistent and reasonable physical state of axion. The constraint of $PQ$ charge in $DFSZ - I$ model is also pointed out. Then, anomalous couplings of axion-photon-photon is re-examined. Triple-couplings of axion with two fermions are studied. The decay of and axion into a pair of photon is also considered via re-normalizable interactions arising from kinetic terms of scalar fields.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01781v1,human
Light Scalars in Light of UV/IR Mixing: Classicalization via Synergy between Vainshtein & Chameleon Screenings,"Effective field theories featuring light scalar fields play a pivotal role in addressing fundamental questions in (astro)particle physics and cosmology. However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects -- referred to as classicalons -- which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01739v1,human
Precision lattice calculation of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electroweak gauge couplings,"We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling, $Δα_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$, and of the electroweak mixing angle in the space-like momentum region up to $Q^2=12\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculation is based on CLS ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, covering five lattice spacings between $0.039$ and $0.085$ fm and a range of pion masses, including the physical point. A refined analysis employing a telescopic window strategy allows for a clean separation of systematic effects across Euclidean distance scales. Statistical precision is further enhanced through low-mode averaging, combined with a spectral reconstruction of the vector-vector correlator at long distances on the most chiral ensembles. We confirm significant tensions of up to $7σ$ at space-like virtualities around $Q^2= 1\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$ between our lattice results for $Δα_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$ and the corresponding data-driven estimates based on $e^+e^-$ cross section data. Combining our lattice data with perturbative QCD via the Euclidean split technique, we obtain at the $Z$-pole $Δα_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(M_Z^2) = 0.027813(33)_{\mathrm{lat}}(35)_{\mathrm{pQCD}}$, which is more than two times more precise than recent data-driven estimates. Our result deviates slightly, by $1-2σ$, from the value produced by global electroweak fits. For the electroweak mixing angle, we present the hadronic contribution to its running and provide a precise determination of the octet-singlet mixing component $\barΠ^{(0,8)}$, in good agreement with phenomenological models but with significantly higher precision.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01623v1,human
Stochastic gravitational wave from graviton bremsstrahlung in inflaton decay into massive spin 3/2 particles,"The detection of primordial gravitational waves would offer a direct evidence of inflation and valuable insights into the dynamics of the early universe. During post-inflation reheating period, when the inflaton coherently oscillates at the bottom of its potential, primordial stochastic gravitational waves may be sourced by its perturbative decay into particles of different spins. Assuming the behavior of the potential near the minimum as a polynomial $V(φ)\sim φ^k$, where $k\ge 2$, and treating the inflaton as coherently oscillating classical field, we calculate the decay of inflaton into a pair of spin $3/2$ particles accompanied by graviton emission. We numerically study the reheating dynamics and calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectra. Our analysis shows that the gravitational wave spectra can offer insights into the microscopic physics during inflation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01579v1,human
Precision Imaging of the Pion Emission Source in Heavy-Ion Collisions via a Global Rest Frame Analysis,"Conventional imaging of pion emission sources, conducted in the center-of-mass frame of individual pion pairs (CMFP), suffers from frame-dependent kinematic distortions that bias the reconstructed source morphology. This method introduces spurious correlations due to the relative boost between the CMFP and the true source rest frame (CMFS), leading to systematic image distortions with a pronounced non-Gaussian tail. We present a transformative approach by performing correlation analysis directly in the global source rest frame (CMFS), the physically meaningful reference frame of the collision fireball. This paradigm shift eliminates kinematic contamination inherent in conventional CMFP-based imaging. The resulting source image shows a dramatic suppression of the non-Gaussian artifact and achieves significantly better agreement with pristine model source functions. Our technique offers a more direct and uncontaminated probe of the intrinsic source geometry, overcoming the limitations of prior methods. It provides a clearer and more accurate determination of the spacetime properties of the nuclear collision fireball, marking a significant advancement in the field.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01251v2,human
Measuring Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Electroweak Phase Transition and Higgs Self-Couplings,"In this work, we demonstrate the complete process of using space-based gravitational wave detectors to measure properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background resulting from a first order electroweak phase transition, to infer the parameters governing the phase transition dynamics as well as that of the underlying particle physics model, and eventually to make predictions for important physical observables such as the Higgs cubic and quartic self-couplings which are difficult to measure at colliders. This pipeline is based on a frequency domain simulation of the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, taking into account dominant instrumental noises and astrophysical background, where the data analysis is carried out using both the Fisher information matrix and Bayesian inference with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo numerical sampling. We have applied this framework to the simplest extension of the Standard Model, the singlet extension, and show the measured uncertainties of the parameters at various levels of inference, and show that the Higgs cubic and also the quartic coupling can be highly constrained from gravitational wave measurement. We also show the impact from the problem of parameter degeneracy, highlighting the corresponding limitation on parameter inference and on making predictions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00996v2,human
High-order cumulants and correlation functions near the critical point from molecular dynamics,"We present a systematic investigation of particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition using molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our prior studies to third- and fourth-order cumulants in both coordinate- and momentum-space acceptances and integrated correlation functions (factorial cumulants). We find that, even near the critical point, non-Gaussian cumulants equilibrate on time scales comparable to those of the second-order cumulants, but show stronger finite-size effects. The presence of interactions and of the critical point leads to strong deviations of the cumulants from the ideal-gas baseline in coordinate space; these deviations are expected to persist in momentum space in the presence of collective expansion. In particular, the kurtosis becomes strongly negative, $κσ^2 \ll -1$, on the crossover side of the critical point. However, this signal is significantly diluted once an efficiency cut used to distinguish protons from baryons is applied, leading to $|κσ^2| \lesssim 1$ even in the presence of the critical point. We discuss our results in the context of ongoing measurements of proton number cumulants in heavy-ion collisions in RHIC-BES-II.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00755v2,human
Constraints on active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moments from low-energy electronic recoils at direct detection experiments,"Sterile neutrinos can potentially be produced through neutrino transition magnetic moments in neutrino-electron scattering. In this work, we probe such interactions for sterile neutrinos in the low-mass regime using low-energy electronic recoil data from direct detection experiments. We derive robust constraints on the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moments, scrutinizing PandaX-4T and XENONnT recent datasets. Detailed statistical analyses are performed, providing exclusion limits at both one and two degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, as we can distinguish neutrino flavors, direct detection experiments offer a unique framework for studying all possible neutrino flavors.

Tau neutrino as a probe of charged non-standard interactions at DUNE,"In this work, we study the influence of charged-current non-standard interactions (CC-NSI) at a DUNE-like experiment. We are particularly interested in the tau neutrino channel accessible at DUNE, given the higher energy neutrino flux expected to be achieved by the experiment. We focus on CC-NSI that may affect the pion decay, the primary source of neutrinos for DUNE.

Implications of portal vector-like lepton on associated Higgs production at a multi-TeV muon collider,"We have explored a portal vector-like lepton (pVLL) extension of the Standard Model (SM) and studied its implications for Higgs and vector-boson associated production ($hV$, with $~V = Z$-boson or dark photon) at a future muon collider facility. We show that while the $~μ^+ μ^- \to hZ~$ production rate remains close to its SM prediction in a wide range of parameter space, the rate for $~μ^+ μ^- \to hγ_d~$ can be substantially enhanced owing to the non-decoupling nature of the interaction involving the heavy lepton, the muon and the dark photon. We demonstrate that the $hγ_d$ production rate can exceed the corresponding $hZ$ rate by a factor of $1$-$100$ within the perturbative unitarity limit, making it a promising channel for probing Higgs interactions and potential new physics effects.   Furthermore, this process can also be used to constrain the dark photon mass ($m_{γ_d}$) and/or the dark gauge coupling ($g_d$) within the pVLL framework. We perform a detailed collider analysis of the $hγ_d$ process in the $b\bar{b}~+$ missing energy final state. A $2σ$ exclusion limit for $m_{γ_d}$ up to $75$ GeV is obtained assuming $~g_d=0.05$, $~\sinθ_L=4\times10^{-5}$, $~\sinθ_s=0.05$, and heavy lepton mass $\gtrsim 2$ TeV at a $3$ TeV muon collider with an integrated luminosity of $1$ ab$^{-1}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00578v1,human
Impact of Localization in Early-Universe QCD Phase Transition,"We introduce a phenomenological modification of the MIT bag model equation of state that incorporates quark localization arising from gluon-induced disorder in the quark-gluon plasma. This model effectively reduces the quark degrees of freedom encoded in the product of the disorder activation function $G(W)$ and the localization efficiency factor $H(T)$. As a result, the critical temperature is increased roughly by 7%. Employing the Friedmann equation, we find that the onset of the phase transition occurs earlier. Consequently, the mixed phase duration is only $8.22\, μs$, which is 24% shorter than the bag model, and the hadronic phase cools faster. The Stephan-Boltzmann constant is reached at much higher temperatures, causing the energy density and pressure curves of the bag model to shift downward and yielding better agreement with the lattice QCD data from the HotQCD collaboration. Our results show that the localization of quarks plays a significant role in the cooling dynamics of the early universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00465v2,human
$ω$-meson transverse twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes,"In this work, we investigate semileptonic decay $D^+\to ω\ell^+ν_{\ell}$ within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rule. By constructing correlation function with right-handed chiral current, the transverse twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDA) $φ^{\perp}_{2;ω}(x,μ)$ dominates the contribution in TFFs. We study the properties of twist-2 LCDA $φ^{\perp}_{2;ω}(x,μ)$ by constructing a light-cone harmonic oscillator model. By applying it to the TFFs, we obtained $A_1(0)=0.537^{+0.053}_{-0.053}$, $A_2(0)=0.540^{+0.068}_{-0.068}$, $V(0)=0.754^{+0.079}_{-0.079}$, and $A_0(0)=0.553^{+0.044}_{-0.043}$ at large recoil point. Two TFF ratios are $r_V=1.40^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$ and $r_2=1.01^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$. After extrapolating those TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$ region by using the simplified $z(q^2,t)$ series expansion, the ratio of longitudinal and transverse decay widths is $Γ_{\rm{L}}/Γ_{\rm{T}}=0.987^{+0.107}_{-0.121}$. Then, we get branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to ωe^+ν_e)=(1.84^{+0.36}_{-0.33})\times 10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to ωμ^+ν_μ)=(1.78^{+0.33}_{-0.30})\times 10^{-3}$, which is in good agreement with BESIII and CLEO Collaborations. Finally, we predict the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm{FB}}^{\ell}$, lepton-side convexity parameter $C^{\ell}_{\rm{F}}$, longitudinal (transverse) polarization $P_{\rm{L}(\rm{T})}^{\ell}$, as well as longitudinal polarization fraction $F_{\rm{L}}^{\ell}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00441v1,human
Optimization of factorization scale in QED Drell-Yan-like processes,The dependence of corrections due to the initial state radiation in $e^+ e^-$-annihilation processes on the choice of the factorization scale is investigated. Different prescriptions of the factorization scale choice are analyzed within the leading and next-to-leading logarithmic approximations. Comparisons with the known complete two-loop results are used to optimize the scale choice.,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00437v1,human
Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider,"We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.0\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410v1,human
An effective field theory for thermal QCD with 2+1 flavours,"We write a long-distance effective field theory (EFT) for QCD at finite temperature just below the crossover temperature $T_c$. The low energy constants (LECs) of this EFT are obtained from lattice measurements of the screening mass of pions at two temperatures for $N_f=2+1$ using lattice results obtained at physical values of pion and Kaon masses, and $N_f=2$ where the lattice simulations were performed with a heavier pion mass. The EFT gives good predictions for other static pion properties for $N_f=2$, where lattice results are available. We show the corresponding predictions for $N_f=2+1$, where they are not yet measured. We demonstrate that EFT gives excellent predictions for the phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$. The predictions for the pressure are investigated, and predictions are also given for a Wick-rotated real-time quantity called the kinetic mass.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00409v1,human
Nucleosynthesis and CMB bounds on photophilic ALPs: a fresh look,"We provide a fresh look at the cosmological constraints on axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple predominantly to photons, focusing on lifetimes $τ_{a} \lesssim 10^{4}\, {\rm s}$ and masses $m_a\lesssim 10\,{\rm GeV}$. We consider Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds and explore how these limits depend upon the unknown reheating temperature of the Universe, $T_{\rm reh}$. Compared with some previous studies, we account for the rare decays of these ALPs into light hadrons and show that this leads to extended constraints for several reheating temperatures. Our limits are cast in a model-independent way, and we identify regions of parameter space where these ALPs could alleviate small tensions in the determinations of $N_{\rm eff}$ and the deuterium abundance.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00157v1,human
Every Wrinkle Carries A Memory: An Integro-differential Bootstrap for Features in Cosmological Correlators,"Motivated by cosmological observations, we push the cosmological bootstrap program beyond the de Sitter invariance lamppost by considering correlators that explicitly break scale invariance, thereby exhibiting primordial features. For exchange processes involving heavy fields with time-dependent masses and sound speeds, we demonstrate that locality in the bulk implies a set of integro-differential equations for correlators on the boundary. These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations. Meanwhile, we also unveil non-perturbative information in the integro-differential equations by resumming apparent infrared divergences as parametric resonances. In addition, we provide a first-of-its-kind example of numerical bootstrap that directly maps out the solution space of such boundary equations. Finally, we compute the bispectrum and uncover, in the squeezed limit, a scale-breaking cosmological collider signal, whose amplitude can be exponentially enhanced (with respect to the Boltzmann suppression) due to particle production triggered by high-frequency mass oscillations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00152v1,human
Rydberg Single Photon Detection for Probing 0.1-10 meV Dark Matter with BREAD,"We introduce a Rydberg-based single photon detector (SPD) for probing dark matter in the 0.1-10 meV mass range (20 GHz-2 THz). The Rydberg SPD absorbs photons produced and focused by the BREAD dish antenna and trades them for free, detectable electrons. At the lower end of the mass range, photons drive Rydberg-Rydberg transitions, which are read out via state-selective ionization. At higher masses, they directly ionize the Rydberg atoms.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00145v1,human
WallGo investigates: Theoretical uncertainties in the bubble wall velocity,"We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find several $\mathcal{O}(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the $\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However, we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity and hence gravitational wave predictions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27691v1,human
"Soft Gravitons, Hard Truths: Infrared Safety of Particle Processes in a Gravitational-Wave Background","Gravitational waves are thought to propagate unattenuated through matter due to a cancellation between graviton absorption and stimulated emission inferred from leading-order soft-graviton arguments. We revisit this reasoning and show that it fails for the converse problem: the effect of a gravitational-wave background on matter. For unstable particles, real graviton emission \emph{and} absorption appear to enhance decay rates. By extending the soft-graviton framework describing real and virtual processes in a gravitational wave background, and resumming them to all orders, we show that inclusive decay rates remain essentially unchanged. The mutual transparency between matter and gravitational radiation thus follows from infrared safety, and not from a fortuitous cancellation in the lowest-order approximation of exclusive rates.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27690v1,human
"Beyond Leading Logarithms in $g_V$: The Semileptonic Weak Hamiltonian at $\mathcal{O}(α\,α_s^2)$","We present the first next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of the electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including the mixed $\mathcal{O}(α\,α_s^2)$ corrections to the vector coupling $g_V$. The analysis combines the evaluation of three-loop anomalous dimensions and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent factorization of short-distance QCD effects. The latter is implemented through a scheme change based on a $d$-dimensional operator product expansion performed inside the loop integrals. The resulting renormalization-group--improved expression for the radiative correction $Δ^V_R = 2.432(16)\%$ can be systematically refined using input from lattice QCD and perturbation theory and improves the consistency of first-row CKM unitarity tests.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27648v1,human
From photons to dikaon -- theoretical insights into $K^+K^-$ production in nuclear collisions,"The production of charged kaon pairs in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions can proceed via photoproduction (gamma-Pomeron interaction) or via photon-photon fusion. An important contribution to this process arises from the decays of scalar, tensor and vector mesons. This study provides a consistent description of K+K- production at both the elementary level (gamma gamma -> meson -> K+K-) and the nuclear level (Pb Pb -> Pb Pb K+K-). The gamma gamma fusion cross section is compared with experimental results from Belle, TPC/Two-Gamma and ARGUS. A comparison with existing midrapidity measurements is presented, together with theoretical predictions for ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27642v1,human
CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production,"A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $α$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $Γ$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587v2,human
Infrared singularities of multileg amplitudes with a massive particle at three loops,"We determine the complete three-loop QCD soft anomalous dimension for multileg amplitudes involving a single massive coloured particle and any number of massless ones. This is achieved by applying a novel strategy based on a lightcone expansion of correlators of semi-infinite Wilson lines using the method of regions. The resulting region integrals depend exclusively on rescaling-invariant ratios that remain finite in the limit. We evaluate these integrals using differential equation techniques. The result is written in terms of uniform weight five generalised polylogarithms of a twelve letter alphabet in three variables, and is compatible with the massless limit as well as with two- and three-particle collinear factorization.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27567v1,human
Symmetry-Protected $α$-Attractor Hybrid Inflation in Supergravity and Constraints from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2,"We present a symmetry-protected supergravity realization of hybrid $α$-attractor inflation with a constant sequestered uplift. The model achieves an exact analytic embedding of the attractor geometry while maintaining vacuum stability and radiative control. The uplift, generated by a hidden Stückelberg $U(1)_D$ sector, preserves the inflaton dynamics and provides an independent handle on the post-inflationary vacuum energy. The framework yields precise next-to-leading-order predictions for the scalar spectral tilt and tensor amplitude, fully consistent with current ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and Planck data. Radiative and geometric corrections remain exponentially suppressed, ensuring the robustness of the inflationary trajectory. This construction offers a minimal, UV-complete, and testable benchmark for embedding $α$-attractor inflation in supergravity, with tensor modes potentially observable by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05545v1,human
Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environments around Black Holes from Gravitational Waves,"Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially revealing the properties of the dark sector and shedding light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424v2,human
Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with stimulated backward reflection,"We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond $\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27416v1,human
Pseudo-Hermitian QFT: relativistic scattering and symmetry structure,"Unitarity is a cornerstone of quantum theory, ensuring the conservation of probability and information. Although non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically associated with open or dissipative systems, pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics shows that real spectra and unitary evolution can still emerge through a suitably defined inner product. Motivated by this insight, we extend the pseudo-Hermitian framework to relativistic quantum field theory and construct a consistent formulation of scattering processes. A novel structural feature of this theory is the presence of distinct metric operators for the in and out sectors, connected through a nontrivial metric projector that guarantees global probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. We further develop a general symmetry formalism, showing that each symmetry generally corresponds to two pseudo-unitary operators associated with the in and out metrics, respectively. Within this framework, the scattering matrix admits a perturbative expansion through the Dyson series and remains Lorentz invariant and unitary, remarkably in complete agreement with the conventional Hermitian case. The fundamental CPT theorem is also shown to hold. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories and open new directions for exploring their possible physical implications beyond the standard Hermitian paradigm.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27404v1,human
Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer,"Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01903v1,human
Constraints on Axion-photon coupling from the Global 21-cm Signal,"A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27180v1,human
Long-Lived HNLs via ALP Portal at the LHC,"Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) and axion-like particles (ALPs) are both considered well-motivated candidates for beyond the standard model (BSM) physics. ALPs with couplings to gluons will be abundantly produced at the LHC. Therefore, HNLs produced via the ALP portal may provide unprecedented sensitivities to HNL parameters. Here, we study the prospects for the high-luminosity LHC to search for long-lived HNLs. We consider future far detectors as well as ATLAS in our simulations. In the limit where the ALP mass is large, HNLs are effectively produced by a dimension-8 operator connecting HNL pairs to gluons. For completeness, we therefore also calculate future LHC sensitivities for HNLs produced via $N_R$SMEFT operators with gluons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26946v2,human
Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks,"Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28μ_N$ to $+3.36μ_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26893v1,human
Running Couplings in High-Temperature Effective Field Theory,"In this work, we study the renormalization-group evolution of parameters in the three-dimensional effective field theory (3D EFT) that describes the thermally driven electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field. We focus on the first-order case, triggered by beyond the Standard Model physics. We compute the two-loop running of the 3D EFT couplings, including the effect of the leading non-renormalizable terms. We then analyze how the new contributions to the beta functions compare with those in the super-renormalizable case, highlighting their impact on perturbative computations of the scalar potential, which describes the vacuum structure of the theory. By incorporating higher-order corrections in the mass parameter evolution, as well as the running of other effective operators, we set the stage for testing their impact on phase transition dynamics in lattice simulations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26878v1,human
Automated event generation for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production in NRQCD and NRQED,"We present an extension of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework that enables the automated calculation of leading-order cross sections for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and non-relativistic QED (NRQED) factorisation formalisms. The framework has been validated against a variety of benchmark processes, demonstrating robustness and flexibility for phenomenological studies. A key advantage of this implementation is its seamless integration with existing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO features, allowing computations not only within the Standard Model but also in a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model or Effective Field Theory scenarios via a modified Universal Feynman Output (UFO) interface. Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation. Through numerous examples, we highlight that theoretical studies of quarkonium processes require careful consideration: the impact of subleading contributions is often difficult to predict using simple counting arguments based solely on the hierarchy of couplings and velocity-scaling rules.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26773v1,human
Robust extraction of power corrections and nuclear dynamics from DIS at large $x$,"We present recent updates from the CTEQ-JLab (CJ) global PDF analysis, focusing on the interplay and implementation systematics of the HT and offshell correction (CJ22ht). We also discuss preliminary results of the CJ25 global analysis, showing the impact of the full JLab 6 GeV datasets, that we recently collected in a comprehensive DIS database, and having a first look at early JLab 12 GeV measurements.

QED corrections to bound-muon decays from an effective-field-theory framework,"Bound-muon decays are a powerful probe of new physics, making precise theoretical predictions for their spectra essential. While QED corrections significantly affect the shape of the spectra, their calculation is extremely challenging below the nuclear scale. By exploring the universality of modern effective-field-theory techniques, we present a framework that systematically computes those corrections across a broad class of bound-muon decays. As a key application, we provide the most accurate predictions to date for the signal and background spectra in muon conversion. We show that radiative corrections modify the leading-order ratio of these spectra by $5\%$ with minimal energy dependence, a result relevant for enhancing the discovery reach of upcoming experiments. Our framework also represents a crucial step toward connecting high-energy physics to low-energy observables, complementing recent progress above the muon mass scale.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26698v1,human
A New Probe for Long-Lived Particles at Higgs Factories: Displaced Photons in the Hadronic Calorimeter,"The search for dark matter and other photon-portal long-lived particles (LLPs) at electron-positron colliders often relies on the mono-photon signature. At future Higgs factories operating at the $Z$-pole, this approach faces a critical challenge: the irreducible background from $e^+e^- \to ν\barνγ$ becomes overwhelming. We propose a novel strategy that overcomes this limitation by searching for displaced photons from LLP decays within the barrel of the hadronic calorimeter. This signature exploits the architectural shielding of the detector to create a nearly background-free environment. Our analysis demonstrates exceptional sensitivity to LLPs with decay lengths from $\sim$1 to $10^6$ meters, improving upon conventional searches by up to one order of magnitude for benchmark photon-portal models.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26649v1,human
One-pion exchange potential in a strong magnetic field,"We derive the one-pion exchange potential (OPEP) in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field using chiral perturbation theory with nonrelativistic nucleons. Our approach is applicable not only to weak magnetic fields but also to strong ones up to around the pion-mass scale. The Green's function of charged pions is modified by the magnetic field, leading to changes in the nuclear force. By numerically evaluating the modified OPEP incorporating its spin and isospin dependencies, we show that the range of the potential decreases in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field as the field strength increases. We also compute the resulting energy shift of the deuteron due to the modified OPEP, which can reach the order of 1 MeV around $|eB| = m_π^2$, which is comparable to the deuteron binding energy.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26544v1,human
The $φp$ bound state in the unitary coupled-channel approximation,"The attractive interaction of the $φ$ meson and the proton is reported by the ALICE Collaboration, and the corresponding scattering length $f_0$ is given as $Re(f_0)=0.85\pm0.34(stat)\pm0.14(syst)$ fm and $Im(f_0)=0.16\pm0.10(stat)\pm0.09(syst)$ fm. The fact that the real part is significant in contrast to the imaginary part indicates a dominating role of the elastic scattering, whereas the inelastic process is less important. In this work, such scattering processes are inspected on the basis of a unitary coupled-channel approximation inspired by the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The $φp$ scattering length is calculated and it is found that the experimental value of the $φp$ scattering length can be obtained only if the attractive interaction of the $φ$ meson and the proton is taken into account. A significant outcome of such an attractive interaction is a two-pole structure in the scattering amplitude. One of the poles, located at $1969-i283$ MeV, might be a resonance state of $φN$, while the other pole, located at $1949-i3$ MeV, should be a bound state of $φN$. Both of these states do not have counterparts in the data of the Particle Data Group(PDG).",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26517v1,human

This includes high baryon-density systems such as neutron-star matter (with a sign problem in lattice gauge theory); fragmentation functions; Monte Carlo generation of particles which accounts for quantum correlations in the final state; entropy production in jets; and generally, any application where time evolution in Minkowski space (as opposed to a Euclidean formulation) or where large chemical potentials play an important dynamical role.

The signals of doomsday II: Cosmological signatures of late time $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking,"The only two gauge symmetries which remain unbroken today are $SU(3)_c$ and $U(1)_{EM}$. Both of them are crucial for our universe to appear the way it does, and for our form of life to exist. Unless we are very special observers living at the very end of the cosmological symmetry breaking chain, there is no reason to believe that these two symmetries will remain unbroken in the future. In this paper, we discuss cosmological observational signatures of the $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking. We introduce a model with a new colored scalar field whose potential supports the first order phase transition through creation of the true vacuum bubbles. We then calculate particle production due to vacuum mismatch and use the event generators to study the decays of the new scalar field and massive gluons. We then use Pythia to hadronize the decay products and get the distributions of produced photons and neutrinos as the final result. They represent a long range signature which, if ever observed, might be interpreted as the signals of the doomsday.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26267v1,human

Quantum Tunnelling Across Hydrogen Bonds: Proton--Deuteron Isotope Effects from a Cornell-Type Potential Model,"Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a double-well Schrödinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01899v1,human
KM3-230213A and IceCube Neutrino Events from Metastable Dark Matter of Primordial Black Hole Origin,"We investigate a scenario in which the recently observed ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A, with a median energy of approximately 220 PeV, as well as the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube Observatory, originate from the decay of superheavy dark matter (DM) particles produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation. To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $β$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26126v1,human
Electroweak form factors of large nuclei as BPS skyrmions,"We employ the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model within the framework of semi-classical quantization to compute both electromagnetic and neutral current form factors for heavy nuclei. Our results show excellent agreement with the experimental data for low- to moderate momentum transfer. Further, we present an analytic expression of the neutral current form factor for generic nuclei, expressed as a power series in the momentum transfer. Our method provides an alternative to existing phenomenological approaches, and is particularly relevant for precision neutrino experiments where control over model-dependent systematics is essential for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25841v1,human
"The dark dimension, proton decay, and the length of the M-theory interval","The existence of a large extra dimension in which only gravity propagates would have spectacular consequences for cosmology and laboratory experiments. In the strong coupling limit of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string theory, the gauge and matter fields live at the end of the eleventh dimension, which becomes a natural candidate for a micron-size \textit{dark dimension}. In this work, however, we show that the length of the M-theory interval is severely constrained by proton decay searches. Our results indicate that in such constructions the size of the eleventh dimension is $R\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-28})$ meters.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25832v1,human
Irreducible Bhabha background in the detection of muonium-antimuonium conversion,"Experiments such as MACS and the proposed MACE study muonium-antimuonium conversion by the energies of the final-state $e^\pm$. The $e^+$ and $e^-$ from an antimuonium decay tend to be non-relativistic and relativistic, respectively, and vice versa for muonium. However, these $e^\pm$ can exchange their energies by hard Bhabha scattering, causing muonium to fake an antimuonium decay signal. We compute the rate for this background and find that, while negligible for MACE, it will become larger than the signal for conversion probabilities less than $10^{-18}$. Measuring the helicity of the $e^-$ will reduce this to $10^{-22}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25828v1,human
Morphology of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs $via$ ${\rm GWInSpect}$,"The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w<1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}<0$), while a stiff EoS ($w>1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}>0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $Ω_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $Ω_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672v2,human
Minijet thermalization and jet transport coefficients in QCD kinetic theory,"We apply weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory to investigate the thermalization of high-momentum on-shell partons (minijets) in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Our approach incorporates isotropic hard thermal loop screening to model soft quark and gluon exchanges, allowing us to verify consistency with established analytic results of jet transport coefficients. We perform kinetic simulations of minijets propagating through a thermal gluon plasma, incorporating both collinear radiation and elastic scatterings. The resulting evolution is compared to predictions from jet transport coefficients, including the longitudinal and transverse jet-quenching parameters $\hat{q}$, energy loss, and the drag coefficient. We find that standard definitions of jet transport coefficients neglect the contributions from recoiling medium particles. Including these contributions restores consistency with the kinetic evolution. Finally, we show that the minijet thermalization time scales remarkably well with $\hat{q}$ and we produce a phenomenological estimate of the minijet quenching time in heavy-ion collisions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25669v1,human
Muon Beam Dump Experiments explicate five-dimensional nature of $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$,"We have investigated the prospects of probing the five-dimensional $U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ interactions in present and future muon dump experiments, namely, NA64$_μ$, M$^3$, MuSIC, and a future muon beam dump experiment. These experiments are classified into two categories: the first two can probe processes where feebly interacting massive particles go into invisible channels, while the latter two can probe processes where these states decay into muon pairs. These two types of experiments are complementary in that they allow exploration of different parameter regions of a model. In our scenario, the presence of multiple massive gauge bosons as Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles leads to an enhancement in the signal events compared to the corresponding four-dimensional scenario. In particular, the decay process into muon pairs enables mass reconstruction of the parent particle, making it possible to directly demonstrate the existence of multiple KK particles in at least some parameter regions. This can provide clear evidence that the origin of the $U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ interaction lies in five dimensions. Furthermore, the muon $(g-2)$ value, which is now consistent with the SM, can be used to exclude specific parameter regions for new particles interacting with muons. We also carefully discuss the non-trivial effects arising from nonzero kinetic mixing.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25613v1,human
$QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ Quark System and Gauge/String Duality,"We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25605v2,human
Out-of-equilibrium contributions to charm hadrons in a fluid-dynamic approach,"Building on previous studies that demonstrated the applicability of a fluid-dynamic description of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the present work extends the framework by computing the out-of-equilibrium contributions to the distribution function of charm hadrons. The analysis includes corrections arising from the initial out-of-equilibrium distribution of charm quarks after a free-streaming phase, as well as from the freeze-out surface within fluid dynamics. These results enable the exact computation of integrated yields and transverse momentum distributions of charm hadrons for different values of the spatial diffusion coefficient, thereby providing the basis for a systematic determination of the charm transport coefficients. In addition, the limits of applicability of the approach are identified by determining the transverse-momentum region in which charm hadrons are described by a well-defined, positive distribution function.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25601v1,human
Resonant production of millicharged scalars in k^2 > 0 electromagnetic wave background,"We investigate the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged scalar particle in an electromagnetic plane wave background with $k^2>0$ which can be realized in a medium with a refractive index $n<1$. We reduce the equation of motion to the Mathieu equation, which has resonant exponentially growing solutions for certain parameter ranges. We show that this resonance indeed occurs for small scalar masses. We apply our results to derive constraints on millicharged particles and compare them with existing experimental data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25505v2,human
Reinforcement Learning techniques for the flavor problem in particle physics,"This short review discusses recent applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to the flavor problem in particle physics. Traditional approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25495v1,human
NLO event generation for LHC neutrinos and application to flux measurements at FASER,"The LHC generates an intense beam of high-energy neutrinos in the forward direction, whose scientific potential has been left unexploited for many years. The FASER and SND@LHC experiments, operating since 2023, have recently measured LHC neutrinos for the first time. In this contribution we discuss how to produce accurate predictions, including NLO QCD corrections and modern parton shower algorithms, for present and future LHC neutrino experiments, including those at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). To this end, the energy and rapidity distribution of the LHC neutrinos is encoded in a LHAPDF grid interfaced to the neutrino DIS event generator in the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework. This Monte Carlo tool enables the modelling of differential distributions that are sensitive to hadronic final states, initial- and final-state radiation, and realistic acceptance and selection cuts. As a first application, we deploy this event generator to compute fast-interpolation grids and carry out a first determination of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes directly from FASER data using the NNPDF fitting methodology.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25486v1,human
Prospects for a fourth generation of leptons in a 13 TeV p-p collider,"In the Standard Model, three discovered generations of leptons and quarks are known to date. However, speculations about existence of next generations have a strong foothold. In this study, we sequentially extrapolate the Standard Model to include a fourth generation of leptons (l4, nu4) with a massive Dirac neutrino. We perform MC simulated event generation of pp -> l4 l4(bar) scattering processes at an LHC-like p-p collider with sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by considering l4 mass of 190 GeV and nu4 mass of 100 GeV with PYTHIA. We demonstrate mass constraints of sequential leptons from oblique parameters and study important jet and lepton kinematics in our simulation with CMS like constraints. Fourth generation neutrino is stable in this scenario making l4 -> W nu4 the only dominant channel in collider searches. With the cut-flow, we achieve global excess of (1.46 +/- 0.068(stat.)) sigma and local excess of (3.33 +/- 0.241(stat.)) sigma in the 180-300 GeV signal window. Missing Transverse Energy (MET) provides clean signature of nu4. We assess discovery potential of the BSM lepton against lepton mass, center-of-mass energy (Ecom) and luminosities. Higher luminosities and Ecom are promising to probe BSM moderate mass lepton scenarios at present and future colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25190v1,human
QCD chiral phase diagram from weak functional renormalization group,"We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite temperature and finite baryon density using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG). While conventional fRG studies often employ techniques such as dynamical bosonization to regularize divergences, we instead pursue the weak solution of the fRG equations which allows for non-analytic behavior in the flow to compute the pure fermionic potential $V_k(ψ,\barψ)$ within the local potential approximation. This approach enables us to explore the effects of purely quark-level fluctuations on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking without introducing any auxiliary bosonic fields. Based on this framework, we present the resulting chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25081v2,human
Covariance of Scattering Amplitudes from Counting Carefully,"Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24866v1,human
Super-Leading Logarithms in Top-Quark Pair Production at Hadron Colliders,"To date, the appearance and resummation of ""super-leading"" logarithms in hadron-hadron collisions has been studied only for massless parton states. We extend the formalism to include an arbitrary number of massive final states. We derive the corresponding anomalous dimension and identify an additional Coulomb phase that gives rise to a new source of super-leading logarithms. We then perform a systematic leading-logarithmic resummation of these contributions for $2\to M$ processes. Finally, we analyze the numerical impact in partonic scattering processes for $t\bar{t}$ production, including a treatment of the Sommerfeld enhancement observed near threshold.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24848v1,human
Heavy Quark Energy Loss in the Hybrid Model,"Heavy quarks offer an invaluable hard probe of the droplets of quark gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC. Given their large mass, they are predominantly produced in hard scattering processes at the earliest moment of a collision and given their rarity they almost never annihilate with a heavy antiquark subsequently. This means that they experience, and probe, the entire history of the expanding, cooling, droplet of QGP from hydrodynamization through hadronization. Quantitative measurements of heavy quark final state observables therefore give us access to information about the transport properties of QGP as well as about medium modifications of hadronization. To date, the Hybrid strong/weak coupling Model of jet quenching has not included any implementation of the heavy-quark sector, which has made it impossible to confront its predictions with measurements of heavy quark and jet observables together, in a unified fashion. Here, we extend the Hybrid Model to investigate heavy quark observables for the first time. We introduce a strongly-coupled calculation of heavy-quark energy loss with the correct behavior when the heavy quarks are either ultrarelativistic or non-relativistic, Gaussian momentum broadening, and recombination of heavy quarks with medium partons using a local color neutralization model of hadronization. We compare our results for the suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and azimuthal anisotropies $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons and $Λ_c$ baryons, the $R_{\rm AA}$ of B-tagged jets, as well as baryon-to-meson ratios, with available experimental data from ALICE, ATLAS and CMS.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24847v1,human
Black Hole Cold Brew: Fermi Degeneracy Pressure,"We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24565v1,human

Probing the existence of a new charged vector boson decaying into heavy neutral leptons using ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions at ATLAS,"In this paper we explore the potential of Ultra-peripheral Collisions in the LHC to investigate new physics, focusing specifically on the production of new charged vector bosons ${V}^{\pm}$ that decay into heavy neutral leptons $N_{L}$ in the context of the Vector Scotogenic Model. We show that the ATLAS experiment searching for dilepton+met final states through UPCs of lead ions, can prove the existence of new charged vector bosons in the mass range 5-100 GeV, a region not explored by the LEP-II experiment. Our analysis identifies regions in the parameter space where the signal can be distinguished from the background with high statistical significance. Within the mass range 5 GeV $<M_{V^{\pm}}, M_{N_L}<$ 100 GeV, ATLAS can exclude scenarios with 95\% of C.L. for specific mass scenarios such as (30 GeV, 20 GeV), (30 GeV, 10 GeV) and (20 GeV, 10 GeV). In a discovery context, ATLAS could reach a significance of 5$σ$ only for (20 GeV, 10 GeV). Furthermore, we show that in the absence of new physics signals at ATLAS, the High Luminosity LHC with UPCs of protons could explore further into larger mass ranges, specifically 100 GeV $< M_{V^{\pm}}<$ 200 GeV and 5 GeV $<M_{N_L}<$ 200 GeV. We find that the HL-LHC can exclude this mass range with 95\% of C.L., and most scenarios can achieve a discovery significance of 5$σ$",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24499v2,human

Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^-$-$n$ Coupling Limit,"By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401v1,human
Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. II,"I discuss the consequences of the constraints imposed on the Dirac spectrum by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the chiral limit of gauge theories with two light fermion flavors, with particular attention to the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry. Under general, physically motivated assumptions on the spectral density and on the two-point eigenvalue correlation function, I show that effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase requires specific spectral features, including a spectral density effectively behaving as $m^2δ(λ)$ in the chiral limit, a two-point function singular at zero, and delocalized near-zero modes, besides an instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. I then discuss a $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|λ|$ in the chiral limit and by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable mechanism for effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a gauge theory.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24392v1,human
Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. I,"I study the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration for the Dirac spectrum in finite-temperature gauge theories in the two-flavor chiral limit, using Ginsparg--Wilson fermions on the lattice. I prove that chiral symmetry is restored at the level of the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears if and only if all these susceptibilities do not diverge in the chiral limit $m\to 0$, with $m$ the common mass of the light fermions. This implies in turn that they are infinitely differentiable functions of $m^2$ at $m=0$, or $m$ times such a function, depending on whether they contain an even or odd number of isosinglet bilinears. Expressing scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities in terms of the Dirac spectrum, I use their finiteness in the symmetric phase to derive constraints on the spectrum, and discuss the resulting implications for the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry in the chiral limit. I also discuss the differentiability properties of spectral quantities with respect to $m^2$, and show from first principles that the topological properties of the theory in the chiral limit are characterized by an instanton gas-like behavior if $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ remains effectively broken.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24381v1,human
Diffractive deep inelastic scattering in the dipole picture: the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution in exact kinematics,"We compute the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to the diffractive structure functions in high-energy deep inelastic scattering. The obtained result corresponds to a finite part of the next-to-leading-order contribution to the diffractive cross section. Previous phenomenological applications have included this contribution only in the high-$Q^2$ or high-$M_X^2$ limits in the case of a soft gluon, and we numerically demonstrate that these existing estimates do not provide a good approximation for the full $q\bar{q}g$ contribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to the soft gluon contribution, there is an equally important soft quark contribution to the diffractive structure functions at high $Q^2$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24171v1,human

This framework has three new elements: (1) updates to the model architecture and training, (2) using over one billion jets used for training, and (3) providing well-documented software for accessing all datasets and models. We demonstrate OmniLearned with three representative tasks: top-quark jet tagging with the community Delphes-based benchmark dataset, b-tagging with ATLAS full simulation, and anomaly detection with CMS experimental data.

Primordial Black Hole Formation and Multimessenger Signals in a Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model,"We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) induced by a first-order electroweak phase transition in a realistic renormalizable framework, the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model.

Furthermore, we show that the same parameter space predicts observable stochastic gravitational waves within the sensitivities of future space-based detectors, as well as a sizable deviation in the Higgs triple coupling that can be probed at future lepton colliders.

Symmetry Energy of 2+1-flavor dense quark matter from perturbative QCD,"The symmetry energy expansion was developed to connect isospin symmetric matter probed in nuclear experiments to asymmetric matter found in neutron stars. Using the isospin asymmetry derived from the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, we derive the symmetry energy expansion for quark matter that has unique properties compared to hadronic matter. To test our methods, we use perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading-order, where realistic quark masses can be included. We find that pQCD at electroweak equilibrium is not isospin symmetric but rather obtains a small skewness term in the symmetry energy expansion. We predict that if equations of state for nuclear matter must match pQCD results, then a non-monotonic dip in the symmetry energy would appear.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23984v1,human
Quantum field theory treatment of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in external fields,"We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23760v1,human
String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories,"The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23738v2,human
Constraining $A\to ZH$ with $H\to t\bar t$ in the Low-Mass Region,"The decay $A\to ZH$ is a characteristic signal of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs), where $A$ and $H$ lie primarily within the same $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, leading to a coupling of order $g_2$ to the $Z$ boson. The subsequent decay $H\to tt^{(*)}$ is particularly promising, as it gives rise to distinct final states involving multiple leptons and $b$-jets. The required splitting between $m_A$ and $m_H$ can naturally occur near the electroweak scale while being consistent with perturbative unitarity. Whereas dedicated ATLAS and CMS searches focused on the region with both top-quarks on-shell, we cover lower masses where one top quark is off-shell by recasting Standard Model $t\bar{t}Z$ measurements of ATLAS and CMS. The obtained limits on $σ(A\to ZH)\times {\rm Br} (H\to t\bar t)$ are between $0.12$ pb and $0.62$ pb. Interestingly, we observe these stringent limits despite a preference (up to $2.5σ$) for a non-zero new physics signal, most pronounced around for $m_A \approx 450-460$ GeV and $m_H\approx 290$ GeV, with a best-fit value of $σ(A \to ZH) \times {\rm Br}(H \to t\bar t) \approx 0.3$ pb.

When long-lived, the presence of this particle can substantially modify the charged lepton Yukawa equilibration temperature in the early universe, necessitating reassessment of lepton flavor effects in thermal leptogenesis and potentially shifting flavor regime boundaries.

Anarchic neutrinos from flavor deconstruction: phenomenology of the lepton sector,"We investigate the neutrino sector in the framework of flavor deconstruction with an inverse-seesaw realization. This setup naturally links the hierarchical charged-fermion masses to the anarchic pattern of light-neutrino mixing. We determine the viable parameter space consistent with oscillation data and study the phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons (HNL) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) processes. Current bounds from direct HNL searches and LFV decays constrain the right-handed neutrino scale to a few TeV, while future $μ\to e$ experiments will probe most of the region with $Λ\lesssim 10~\text{TeV}$.

Sub-GeV dark matter and multi-decay signatures from dark showers at beam-dump experiments,"In models of strongly-interacting dark sectors, the production of dark quarks at accelerators can give rise to dark showers with multiple dark mesons in the final state. If some of these dark mesons are sufficiently light and long-lived, they can be detected with searches for displaced vertices at beam-dump experiments and electron-positron colliders. In this work we focus on the case that dark quark production proceeds via effective operators, while the dark sector analogue of the $ρ^0$ meson can decay via kinetic mixing. We evaluate current constraints from NA62 and BaBar as well as sensitivity projections for SHiP and Belle II. We find that there exists a sizable parameter region where SHiP may detect several displaced vertices in a single event and thus obtain valuable information about the structure of the dark sector.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23696v1,human
New Bounds on Heavy QCD Axions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4 abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe, because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV. Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23695v1,human
"Pentaquarks on the light front, and their mixture with baryons","In previous papers we developed the light front formulation for Hamiltonians and wave functions (WFs) for mesons and baryons, with both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. For baryons limited to the lowest Fock component with three quarks, the longitudinal WF is valued in an equilateral triangle with momentum fractions $x_i,i=1,2,3$. The WF was developed both numerically and using a basis function that diagonalizes the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper we extend this analysis to $n$ quark states, and specialize to pentaquarks ($n=5$). We determine their masses and WFs, and address the mixing between baryons and pentaquarks, the issue central to understanding the observed antiquark sea of baryons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23404v2,human
Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Dark Matter in Flux Compactification,"We study a six-dimensional U(1)$_χ$ gauge theory compactified on a magnetized torus, where the zero mode of the extra-dimensional gauge field (a Wilson-line (WL) scalar field) plays the role of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) candidate. The pNG DM is naturally included by construction without introducing an additional scalar field. We show that the leading spin-independent DM-nucleus amplitude is suppressed by momentum transfer in our model as expected from the pNG DM model. This suppression allows the model to evade the current severe direct-detection bounds while achieving the observed thermal relic abundance in well-defined regions of parameter space.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23388v1,human
Investigation of Resonances in the $Σ({1/2}^{-})$ System Based on the Chiral Quark Model,"In this work, we investigate the resonance structures in the $Σ(1/2^-)$ system from both three-quark and five-quark perspectives within the framework of the chiral quark model. An accurate few-body computational approach, the Gaussian Expansion Method, is employed to construct the orbital wave functions of multiquark states. To reduce the model dependence on parameters, we fit two sets of parameters to check the stability of the results. The calculations show that our results remain stable despite changes in the parameters. In the three-quark calculations, two $Σ(1/2^-)$ states are obtained with energies around 1.8~GeV, which are good candidates for the experimentally observed $Σ(1750)$ and $Σ(1900)$. In the five-quark configuration, several stable resonance states are identified, including $Σπ$, $N \bar{K}$, and $N \bar{K}^{*}$. These resonance states survive the channel-coupling calculations under the complex-scaling framework and manifest as stable structures. Our results support the existence of a two-pole structure for the $Σ(1/2^-)$ system, predominantly composed of $Σπ$ and $N \bar{K}$ configurations, analogous to the well-known $Λ(1380)$-$Λ(1405)$ ($Σπ$-$N \bar{K}$) system. On the other hand, although the energy of the $N \bar{K}^{*}$ configuration is close to that of $Σ(1750)$ and $Σ(1900)$, the obtained width is not consistent with the experimental values. This suggests that the $N \bar{K}^{*}$ state needs to mix with three-quark components to better explain the experimental $Σ(1750)$ and $Σ(1900)$ states. According to our decay width calculations, the predicted two resonance states are primarily composed of $Σπ$ and $N \bar{K}$, with their main decay channel being $Λπ$.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23378v1,human
Generating Sizable Real and Imaginary $τ$ Electric Dipole Moment,"The CP-violating electric dipole moment~(EDM) of a fermion provides a powerful probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model~(SM). Among the charged leptons, the $τ$ EDM remains the least constrained. When the photon has timelike momentum, the EDM develops an imaginary part. It imposes stronger constraints on new physics~(NP) than the real part. Although the current experimental bounds are several orders of magnitude above the Standard Model prediction, new physics can generate significantly larger values. Our analysis shows that an axion-like coupling of the $τ$ lepton in the two-Higgs-doublet model can induce sizable real and imaginary components of the EDM, despite the stringent constraints imposed by current axion-like particle experiments. The predicted EDM values may approach the present experimental sensitivities, making them accessible to future measurements at Belle II and the Super Tau-Charm Facility.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23348v1,human
Probing CP Violation through Vector Boson Fusion at High-Energy Muon Colliders,"We investigate CP-violating effects in electroweak interactions at future high-energy muon colliders within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Focusing on four dimension-six CP-odd operators -- $ \mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{W}}, \mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{W}}, \mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{W}B}, \mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{B}}$ -- we analyze vector boson fusion production of $W$ and Higgs bosons using CP-odd observables and their asymmetries. With detailed simulations including parton showering, hadronization, and detector effects, we derive exclusion sensitivities through a binned likelihood analysis. For example, at $\sqrt{s} = 3$ TeV with 2 ab$^{-1}$, the coefficient $C_{\widetilde{W}}$ can be constrained at the $\mathcal{O}(0.02)$ level, improving to $\mathcal{O}(0.008)$ at 10 TeV with 2 ab$^{-1}$, and $\mathcal{O}(0.003)$ with 10 ab$^{-1}$. These results significantly surpass current LHC and projected ILC sensitivities, demonstrating the unique potential of high-energy muon colliders to provide direct and model-independent probes of CP violation in the electroweak sector.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23257v1,human
Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation,"Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{aγ} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23113v2,human
Bose-Einstein Condensate Cosmology within the Framework of QCD Axion,"Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) cosmology is analyzed in the framework of a string-inspired axion model. The dispersion relation of the axionic mode includes both gravitational and self-interaction terms, the latter being small in magnitude but crucial for inducing instability of the condensate. The generation rate of BEC around redshift $z\approx 30$ is primarily governed by gravity, consistent with a phenomenological value $Γ\approx 10^{-31}$ eV adopted in previous work and realizable for the QCD axion. The relation between this early BEC epoch and the later formation of supermassive black holes at $z\approx 5$ is also discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22974v1,human
Effective Theory for Light Portal Dark Matter Detection,"We develop a general framework for the computation of light portal dark matter direct detection, incorporating a consistent treatment of finite momentum transfer. In this framework, dark matter interacts with Standard Model matter through a light mediator, which simultaneously serves as the force carrier for dark matter self-interaction, potentially with a distinct coupling strength. The corresponding effective theory relevant for detecting this class of dark matter is systematically constructed. Our analysis focuses on light (semi)relativistic dark matter, which may originate from cosmic-ray boosting and can be probed in high threshold experiments such as large-volume neutrino detectors. In this context, the nucleon matrix elements of the effective operators at finite momentum transfer are required, made available through recent advances in lattice QCD and related nonperturbative methods. The relativistic Fermi gas model is used to convert the nucleon-level momentum transfer to the nuclear level, thereby incorporating nuclear effects pertinent to heavy target experiments. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we present ultraviolet-complete examples featuring spin-1 and spin-2 portal dark matter. For these models, we compute the differential cross sections with respect to momentum transfer, adopting parameter choices that address the so-called core-cusp problem in astrophysical observations via dark matter self-interactions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22966v1,human
Axion in the minimal SO(10) GUT,"The QCD axion is investigated within the minimal supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory, where the Yukawa sector involves Higgs multiplets ${\bf 10}$ and $\overline{\bf 126}$. The relative phase between the VEVs of $({\bf 10,1,3})\subset\overline{\bf 126}$ and $({\bf \overline{10},1,3})\subset{\bf 126}$ under ${\rm SU}(4)_C\times{\rm SU}(2)_L\times{\rm SU}(2)_R$ is identified with the axion. The Peccei-Quinn and $B-L$ symmetry breaking scales coincide through $|\langleΔ_R\rangle|=|\langle\overlineΔ_R\rangle|$. The scalar partner of the lightest right-handed neutrino plays the role of the inflaton, realizing hybrid inflation consistent with the observed CMB density fluctuations. After inflation, both fields acquire VEVs, and the domain-wall problem is resolved through the Lazarides-Shafi mechanism, which naturally restricts the model to three generations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22962v1,human
The anomalous spin-statistics connection arising from pseudo-Hermiticity,"We establish a new spin-statistics theorem for a class of free pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories whose particles furnish unitary irreducible representations of the Poincaré group. In this framework, free pseudo-Hermitian fields with integer spin exhibit fermionic statistics, whereas those with half-integer spin exhibit bosonic statistics, opposite to the conventional case. This reversal arises from defining canonical field operators using pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rather than Hermitian conjugation, thereby circumventing the conventional spin-statistics theorem. The free fields retain locality, Lorentz covariance, and unitary evolution. However, interactions may violate unitarity due to the intrinsically non-Hermitian nature of the full Hamiltonian. We discuss potential resolutions to restore unitarity in interacting theories.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22952v1,human

The BESIII experiment has contributed significantly in the study of the XYZ particles, and here we review the discoveries of the Zc(3900), Zc(4020), and Zcs(3985) tetraquark states and the observations of several new vector charmoniumlike states at the BESIII experiment.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22921v1,human
Local gauge invariant operator on isometry breaking background,"Whereas local field operators play the crucial role in reconciling quantum mechanics and special relativity, they are not trivially compatible with the diffeomorphism invariance of gravity. In order to address this issue, we consider the background geometry which breaks the isometry spontaneously. Then the local gauge invariant operator can be constructed through the Stückelberg mechanism, where the fluctuation of the metric in the direction of the isometry breaking combines with that of matter whose classical solution breaks the isometry. This is equivalent to introducing the clock and the rod to promote the local field operators to the gauge invariant ones. A typical example is the curvature perturbation in quasi-de Sitter space arising from the spontaneous breaking of the timelike isometry. We also discuss the features of the local gauge invariant operator when the spacelike isometry is spontaneously broken. Meanwhile, even if the local gauge invariant operators exist, it does not guarantee the reliable construction of the gauge invariant operators on the local region like the island, which is regarded as an essential ingredient to resolve the black hole information paradox. This is because the fluctuation of the spacetime point is accumulated in time, which in fact also gives rise to eternal inflation in quasi-de Sitter space. In order to suppress the fluctuation at late time, the isometry must be strongly broken by the background. In the case of the evaporating black hole, it may be achieved by the transition to the higher dimensional black hole.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22879v1,human
Mass and Decay-Constant Evolution of Heavy Quarkonia and $B_c$ States from Thermal QCD Sum Rules,"We analyze the thermal behavior of heavy vector and axial-vector mesons ($J/ψ$, $Υ$, and $B_c$) within the finite-temperature QCD sum-rule framework. Using updated PDG-2024 quark masses, modern lattice-informed gluon condensates, and a temperature-dependent continuum threshold constrained by vacuum stability, we compute the evolution of the masses $m(T)$ and decay constants $f(T)$ up to $T/T_c \lesssim 0.9$. At $T=0$ the sum rules are calibrated to reproduce the experimental and LHCb masses and reference decay constants within the expected $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ accuracy of a leading-order $+$ $D{=}4$ analysis, and we interpret the subsequent finite-temperature evolution as a genuine prediction of the framework.   Near the critical temperature, the relative suppression follows a clear hierarchy $Υ< J/ψ< B_c$, consistent with their binding energies and lattice spectral trends. The predicted $1P$--$1S$ splitting for the $B_c$ system, $0.477~\mathrm{GeV}$, matches the LHCb observation of orbitally excited $B_c^{+}$ states. The results provide a coherent finite-temperature baseline for future extensions including radiative, higher-dimensional, and width effects.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22870v3,human

Probing Axion-Photon conversion via circular polarization imprints in the CMB $V$-mode observations,"In the presence of a background magnetic field, axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) can be resonantly converted to photons when their mass is nearly equal to the effective photon mass. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the parameter space of ALPs by investigating the resulting imprints of axion-photon conversion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We show that a helical magnetic field existing prior to the CMB epoch can generate an excess population of photons carrying net circular polarization due to the axion-photon conversion mechanism. Consequently, current measurements of the angular power spectrum of circular polarization ($V$-mode) in the CMB can be used to constrain the parameter space of ALP mass and its coupling to photons. In the optimistic scenario of a maximally helical magnetic field with strength $\sim {\rm nG}$, we find that CLASS observations at $40 \, {\rm GHz}$ can probe the previously unconstrained regions of axion-photon coupling corresponding to ALP masses in the range $10^{-10}-10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22592v1,human
Detecting ultralight dark matter in the Galactic Center with pulsars around Sgr A*,"Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model is a leading dark matter candidate that arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model. In the Galactic Center, ULDM manifests as dense hydrogen-like boson clouds or self-gravitating soliton cores. We present the first study of the gravitational effects of these ULDM structures on pulsar orbits around Sgr A*, using pulsar timing as a precision dynamical probe, based on a comprehensive and practical framework that includes various kinds of black hole and orbital parameters. Our analysis shows that long-term pulsar monitoring -- one of the key objectives of future SKA science -- could detect a boson cloud with a total mass as low as $O(M_\odot)$ for boson mass $m \sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, and probe a wide range of soliton core masses in the lower-mass regime, assuming a conservative timing precision of $σ_{\mathrm{TOA}}=1\,\mathrm{ms}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22573v1,human
Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter,"We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing, invalidating the canonical light axion scenario. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the canonical heavy axion scenario remains valid. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22569v1,human
Collectivity in pPb Collisions with Femtoscopy,"Collisions of protons with lead nuclei (pPb), such as those measured by the LHCb experiment, provide a unique environment to study the surprising emergence of collective, fluid-like phenomena in small systems. A key signature of this hydrodynamic behavior is the predicted formation of a toroidal vorticity structure. In this work, I use two-particle femtoscopic correlations of non-identical hadrons, specifically proton-pion ($pπ^+$) pairs, as a novel probe for this phenomenon. Previous works indicate that the collective flow of the system is consistent with the formation of a vortex ring created by the passage of the proton through the lead nucleus, which modifies the collective flow profile. I establish that the resulting emission asymmetry between protons and pions, driven by their mass difference and differential response to the vortical flow, is directly linked to the initial vorticity and can be measured using femtoscopy. This method therefore presents a new, sensitive observable for characterizing the rotational dynamics of the matter created in small collision systems.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22456v1,human
Symmetry principles of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments,"The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22346v2,human
"Analyzing GW231109_235456 and understanding its potential implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy","We study the gravitational-wave trigger GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidate observed in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Assuming the trigger is of astrophysical origin, we analyze it using state-of-the-art waveform models and investigate the robustness of the inferred source parameters under different prior choices in Bayesian inference. We assess the implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Analysing the component masses, we find that GW231109_235456 supports the proposed double Gaussian mass distribution of neutron star masses. Moreover, we find that the remnant most likely collapsed promptly to a black hole and that, because of the large distance, a possible kilonova connected to the merger was noticeably dimmer than AT2017gfo. In addition, we provide constraints on the equation of state from GW231109_235456 alone, as well as combined with GW170817 and GW190425. In our projections for the future, we simulate a similar event using the upcoming generation of gravitational-wave detectors.

Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation,"The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem"", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2σ$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1σ$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$.

Potential of discovering $Ξ_{cc}^+$ in $Λ_b $ decays,"We propose to search for $Ξ_{cc}^+$ in the decay $Λ_b \to Ξ_{cc}^+ D^-$, which serves as a tagged and reconstructible source of $Ξ_{cc}^+$, providing an experimentally clean environment for its discovery. A possible fully charged final state is $[(pK^- K^- π^+)_{Ξ^0_c} π^ + ]_{Ξ_{cc}^+} \,(K^+ π^- π^-)_{D^-}$, where the subscripts indicate the parent hadron in the decay chain. We estimate the branching fraction to be ${\cal B}(Λ_b \to Ξ_{cc}^+ D^-) = ( 5.1 \pm 3.9) \times 10^{-4}$, while the fully charged final state corresponds to an effective branching fraction of order $10^{-8}$.

Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant,"We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $Λ$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $Λ$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $Λ$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2σ$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $Ω_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931v1,human
How to Build an Empirical Speed Distribution for Dark Matter in the Solar Neighborhood,"The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21914v1,human
Subleading Effects in Soft-Gluon Emission at One-Loop in Massive QCD,"We provide the last missing ingredient necessary to approximate one-loop amplitudes in QCD with massive quarks in the limit of vanishing energy of a single gluon up to terms suppressed by this energy. Our main result is a soft operator acting in color and spin space that manipulates the momenta of the hard partons while keeping them on-shell and respecting momentum conservation. Additionally, we provide a complete expression for the subleading term of the expansion of an arbitrary tree-level amplitude in the limit where the momenta of a massless quark and a massless anti-quark of the same flavor become collinear.

Electroweak corrections to $gg\rightarrow γγ$,"We present the electroweak corrections for the production of a photon pair through gluon fusion, focusing on the contribution from the first two generations of quarks. The two-loop amplitude is calculated using a series of projection operators which define scalar form factors. In order to evaluate the Master Integrals which appear in this process we employ both generalized polylogarithms and Chen-iterated integrals. In order to perform a phenomenological study we develop a semi-numerical evaluation of the Master Integrals employing a fitting procedure to speed up the evaluation of burdensome higher weight contributions. We present results for the LHC, finding corrections of around a couple of percent to the leading order $gg \rightarrow γγ$ process. Our results are implemented into the parton-level Monte Carlo code \texttt{MCFM}.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21643v1,human
"Five-loop beta function for gauge theories: computations, results and consequences","At the end of 2016, we computed the five-loop (N$^4$LO) contributions to the beta function in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), its generalization to non-Abelian gauge theories with a simple compact Lie group, and for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Here we recall main tools used in and specifically developed for this computation and its main analytic and numerical results. The development work carried out for this project facilitated further even more involved analytic five-loop computations. We briefly summarize also their numerical QCD results for Higgs-boson decay to hadrons in the heavy-top limit and for two N$^4$LO splitting functions for the evolution of quark distributions of hadrons. The latter lead to a first realistic estimate of the five-loop contribution to another important quantity in perturbative QCD, the quark cusp anomalous dimension.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21624v2,human
The Standard Model partial unification scale as a guide to new physics model building,"In the Standard Model, partial unification of the non-Abelian running gauge couplings is achieved at the scale $μ^{\rm SM}_{32} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. Elaborating on this fact, we discuss a simple general parametrization for the new physics corrections leading to full unification at some scale $M_X$. We show that for any new physics model such that the corrections to the non-Abelian couplings are equal (or nearly so), $M_X$ is equal (or close to) the partial unification scale $μ^{\rm SM}_{32}$; the latter scales could be disentangled only if the corrections to the non-Abelian couplings are significantly different. We explore how the parametrization works for some relevant models with new physics below $M_X$, as low energy supersymmetry, split supersymmetry, etc. As for models with a desert up to $M_X$, we explore in particular how the parametrization works for string inspired corrections; we find a phenomenologically remarkable possibility for unification at about $100$ TeV, suggesting a low string scale, in addition to the more conservative possibility for unification at $μ^{\rm SM}_{32}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21420v1,human
Semileptonic $Λ_c \to Λ\ell ν_\ell$ Decays in Light-Cone QCD Sum Rules with $Λ_c$ Distribution Amplitudes,"We study the semileptonic decay of its SU(3) partner, the $Λ_c \to Λ\ell^+ ν_\ell$ ($\ell = e, μ$) transition, within the framework of light-cone QCD sum rules (LCSR) by using the distribution amplitudes of heavy $Λ_c$ baryon. The numerical analysis is performed using two different sets of $Λ_c$ baryon light-cone distribution amplitudes. The resulting form factors are parametrized by a model-independent $z$-series expansion and used to compute the differential and total decay widths. Our predictions for the branching fractions are in good agreement with the latest BESIII measurements and with lattice-QCD results.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21409v1,human
Gaussian Processes for Inferring Parton Distributions,"The extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or lattice QCD data is an ill-posed inverse problem, where regularization strongly impacts both systematic uncertainties and the reliability of the results. We study a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct PDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian processes serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and constraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide range of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We quantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler divergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of the method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric approach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and reduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21041v2,human
Nonleptonic $Ω_{b}^{*}\rightarrowΩ_{c}^{*} P(V)$ weak transitions in QCDF,"We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom baryon $Ω_{b}^{*}$ into $Ω_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the framework of QCD factorization. Employing the QCD factorization framework and incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute the decay amplitudes and decay widths of the $Ω_{b}^{*}\rightarrowΩ_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the $Ω_{b}^{*}\rightarrowΩ_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the decay widths and branching fractions for all relevant weak channels. This study complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions $Ω_{b}^{*}\rightarrowΩ_{c}^{*}\ell\barν_{\ell}$ reported in Ref.~\cite{Amiri:2025gcf}, thereby providing a comprehensive investigation of all possible $Ω_{b}^{*}\rightarrowΩ_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the $Ω_{b}^{*}$ baryon.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20937v1,human
Natural supersymmetry at a muon collider,"There is great interest within the particle physics community for building a $μ^+μ^-$ collider with center-of-mass (CoM) energies ranging from $\sqrt{s}\sim$ 1-14 TeV. For Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics, natural supersymmetry seems perhaps the most motivated, plausible extension of the Standard Model. Here, we examine what can be accomplished by a muon collider with regards to natural SUSY at various muon collider CoM energies. In natural SUSY -- especially in the guise that would emerge from the string landscape -- one expects sparticles to be spread over two orders of magnitude in mass values. A muon collider with highly variable beam energies would be most useful for targeting 2-body reaction thresholds and Higgs boson resonances.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20920v1,human
Shear viscosity of a binary mixture for a relativistic fluid at high temperature,"The determination of the shear viscosity is a central topic in various areas of modern physics. In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear viscosity $η$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting with different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information on the interaction among different species, various combinations of the viscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the Chapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such single component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that, in most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear average of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from being general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for $η$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the Boltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo formula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD thermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $η/s$ of such system of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the individual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20704v1,human
An Axial-Vector Leptophilic Fifth Force Sourced by Solar Neutrinos,"We investigate long-range, purely leptophilic axial-vector interactions mediated by a light gauge boson $A'$ that couples to charged leptons and, by weak symmetry, to left-handed neutrinos. We analyze two realizations, a minimal effective model with muon-only couplings and an anomaly-free axial $U(1)'$ with inter-generation cancellations. In both cases, the solar neutrino flux acts as an extended current that sources a macroscopic $A'$ field at Earth, with spatial components aligned along the Sun-Earth direction. This field produces a distinctive signature in storage-ring measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $(g-2)_μ$, namely a diurnal, sign-changing contribution that is positive during daytime and negative at night, superimposed on a time-independent positive offset. We obtain bounds $g' \lesssim {O}(10^{-19})$ in both model frameworks for a light, effectively massless mediator. For completeness, we map the solar-neutrino-sourced potential to electron spin-sensor experiments and find $g' \lesssim {O}(10^{-22})$ in the electron channel.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20672v1,human
On the Resonance Coupling and Width in Quantum Field Theory,"In quantum field theory, characteristics of resonances are related to self-energy diagrams, which are ultra-violet divergent and require renormalization.

We consider a Higgs boson decaying into bottom (charm) quark pairs via Yukawa interaction and into gluons via an effective vertex in the limit of infinite top quark mass. We present results for the two decay modes separately, highlighting relevant differences in the differential distributions, and for the sum of all decay channels, including a comparison between different choices of the Durham (or $k_T$) jet resolution parameter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20485v1,human
Eigen-microstate Signatures of Criticality in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions,"We introduce a novel eigen-microstate approach to expose critical patterns in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We explicitly construct the original microstate, defined as the final-state particle fluctuations of a single event. By examining ensembles of such microstates with controlled critical signals, we demonstrate that the approach is highly effective in detecting and quantifying critical patterns, with the largest eigenvalue serving as a robust order parameter. This framework is directly applicable to RHIC Beam Energy Scan data, offering a powerful new direction in the search for the QCD critical point.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20336v1,human
Gauss-Bonnet entropy and thermal dynamics of RN-AdS black holes,"We explore the thermodynamics of a novel solution for the Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, uniquely incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal stability of the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole within the framework of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20183v1,human

A simple model for PDFs and nPDFs,"We present the main results of our recent papers, where we derived an analytical solution of the QCD evolution equations for parton distribution functions. The valence and non-singlet quark components satisfy the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith and Gottfried sum rules, respectively, while momentum conservation is maintained for the singlet quark and gluon densities. Several phenomenological parameters were extracted from a combined fit to precision data on the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ collected by the BCDMS, H1, and ZEUS Collaborations, comprising a total of 933 points from 5 datasets. We proposed a model for nuclear medium modifications of parton densities. The approach is based on a global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model, incorporating Fermi motion effects. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio $F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^{D}(x,Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$, we obtained predictions for nuclear parton distribution functions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20139v1,human
Dephasing in binary black hole mergers surrounded by scalar wave dark matter clouds,"Scalar fields of masses between $10^{-21}\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-11} \rm{eV}/c^2$ can exhibit enhanced gravitational interactions with black holes, and form scalar clouds around them. Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $Mμ_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark matter environments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20037v1,human
Constructive Heavy Particle Effective Theory with Nonlinear Poincaré Symmetry,"We develop a constructive heavy particle effective theory (HPET) through the nonlinear realization of the spontaneously broken Poincaré symmetry $R^{3,1} \rtimes SO(3,1) \rightarrow R^{3,1} \rtimes SO(3)$. Starting from the heavy one-particle state, we find the nonlinear boost transformation indicates the shift symmetry in the coset construction, corresponding to the reparameterization invariance. Using the little group Wigner rotation, we obtain the nonlinear boost transformation for corresponding heavy field, recovering the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. At the operator level, since interaction terms would modify the nonlinear transformation, we propose a most general parametrization on the boost transformation only based on symmetry. The nonlinear boost transformation relates different Wilson coefficients of the HPET operators, providing a bottom-up approach of constructing the independent HPET operators, and generalizing the top-down HPET operators beyond the tree-level integrating out. Utilizing the HPET as example, we obtain additional constraints for the boost transformation as well as the additional variation $δ\mathcal{L}$ at the $1/m^3$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19929v1,human
Generative Unfolding of Jets and Their Substructure,"Unfolding, for example of distortions imparted by detectors, provides suitable and publishable representations of LHC data. Many methods for unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding using machine learning have been proposed, but no generative method scales to the several hundred dimensions necessary to fully characterize LHC collisions. This paper proposes a 3-stage generative unfolding framework that is capable of unfolding several hundred dimensions. It is effective to unfold the jet-level kinematics as well as the full substructure of light-flavor jets and of top jets, and is the first generative unfolding study to achieve high precision on high-dimensional jet substructure.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19906v2,human
Warped Dimensions at the Cosmological Collider,"Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19900v2,human
A graphical representation of gluonic operators,"Composite local operators are central to effective field theories (EFTs), as they define interaction vertices in effective Lagrangians and play a fundamental role in investigating the structure of quantum field theories. The contribution of high-dimensional operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) grows increasingly important as experimental precision improves at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in future colliders. However, the number of operators increases very rapidly with dimension, making it extremely challenging to identify their complete set. In our previous work \cite{Jin:2020pwh}, we proposed a systematic method for generating gluonic operators using primitive operators. In this paper, we introduce a graphical representation of gluonic operators and, based on this representation, present a method to systematically construct primitive operators. Using this method, we derive primitive operators corresponding to gluonic operators of length 2 to length 7 in $D$-dimensions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19696v1,human
Engineering the shapes of quark-gluon plasma droplets by comparing anisotropic flow in small symmetric and asymmetric collision systems,"The observation of collective flow phenomena in small collision systems challenges our understanding of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation and evolution. This complexity lies in the initial geometries, which are influenced by both nucleon configuration and subnucleonic fluctuations, introducing uncertainties in interpreting flow patterns. We disentangle these contributions through comparative measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in asymmetric $d$+Au and symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, which produce medium of comparable sizes but with vastly different initial geometries. The larger $v_2$ in $d$+Au reflects its dominant elliptic geometry, while the similar $v_3$ in both systems is better explained by considering subnucleonic fluctuations. These contrasting flow patterns are quantitatively described by a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model tuned to large-system Au+Au data, indicating efficient transformation of initial geometries to final-state anisotropies. These results provide evidence for droplet formation in small systems with transport properties that are similar to those observed in large collision systems, consistent with QGP-like behavior.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19645v1,human
Beyond Standard Model equation of state and primordial black holes,"The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19629v1,human
Interpreting the 650 GeV and 95 GeV Higgs Anomalies in the N2HDM,"Recent experimental hints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in di-photon and partially in the $τ^+τ^-$ final states suggest the possible existence of an additional Higgs boson with a mass around 95 GeV. Interestingly, these observations are consistent with earlier results from the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider, which pointed to an excess in $b\bar b$ final states within a similar mass range. Additionally, CMS has observed an excess in the $γγb\bar{b}$ final state, indicating a possible resonance near 650 GeV decaying into a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or into a SM-like Higgs boson accompanied by a lighter scalar with mass near 95 GeV. In this work, we investigate whether these anomalies can be simultaneously explained within the Next-to-2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector featuring two complex Higgs doublets and an additional real singlet. Assuming the existence of a CP-even Higgs state compatible with the 95 GeV excesses (restricted to the $γγ$ and $b\bar b$ channels), we analyse the Type-II and Type-Y Yukawa structures, taking the observed 650 GeV resonance to be a CP-even Higgs state. An extensive parameter scan is performed, incorporating the latest constraints. Our results show that a heavy CP-even Higgs resonance around 650 GeV, produced predominantly via gluon-gluon fusion and subsequently decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson together with another scalar at approximately 95 GeV, can be simultaneously accommodated within both the N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y frameworks at a significance level of 2$σ$. This interpretation leads to distinctive and testable predictions from the N2HDM for the ongoing LHC Run-3 and the forthcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) phase.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19605v1,human

The Bjorken sum data from Jefferson Lab, together with the world data on $α_s$ reported by the Particle Data Group, allow us to determine the running of $α_s(Q)$ over five orders of magnitude in four-momentum $Q$. We present two possible future measurements of the running of $α_s(Q)$ using the Bjorken sum rule: the first at the EIC, covering the range $1.5 < Q < 8.7$ GeV, and the second at Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV, covering the range $1.0 < Q < 4.7$ GeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19556v2,human
Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors,"The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) exper- iments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present co- herent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CEνNS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19513v1,human
Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?,"In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485v1,human
Pion-Kaon femtoscopy as a probe of the space-time emission anisotropies due to interactions at the hadronic stage of matter evolution in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Emission asymmetries between pions and kaons reflect the role of the hadronic phase in the cooling of a droplet of deconfined strongly-interacting matter. This study compares results from two models at the same collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV to investigate how interactions in the hadronic phase affect particle emission. The first model, iHKM, provides a complete description of all stages of the evolution; from the initial scattering and thermalization to the final hadronic state, while the second model, LQTH (LHYQUID+THERMINATOR2), assumes a sudden conversion into hadrons, neglecting further interactions. To increase the sensitivity to hadronic interactions, the analysis was performed as a function of the pair transverse velocity for pairs with nearly equal velocity vectors. The obtained predictions are compared with previously measured ALICE data at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV as a function of the cube root of the average particle multiplicity density at midrapidity, showing that both radii and emission asymmetries scale with particle multiplicity, regardless of the collision energy. The iHKM model reproduces the measured trends both qualitatively and quantitatively, whereas the LQTH model requires additional parameters-in particular, a time delay in the emission of kaons-to achieve quantitative agreement. The comparative analysis also indicates a possible non-monotonic behavior of the asymmetry as a function of transverse velocity, and a constant scaling of the ratio between the emission asymmetry and femtoscopic radii with particle multiplicity. These results highlight the importance of including interactions in the hadronic stage for a complete description of the emission function.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19320v1,human
Charge distribution of the gauge-mediation type Q ball,"We numerically study the formation of the gauge-mediation type Q balls in the logarithmic square potential on three-dimensional lattices. We obtain the broad charge distribution of the Q ball of this type for the first time. The charge of the Q ball at the peak of the distribution is smaller than what we estimated as the average of the largest tens of the Q balls in the logarithmic potential for the same initial amplitude of the field at the onset of its oscillation. We also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls. We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by them. On the other hand, the large L balls (Q being the lepton number) would be the dark matter as well while avoiding the constraints on the X and/or gamma rays from the decay of the smaller L balls.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19275v1,human

Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions,"We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions. Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds could be strengthened by future observations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975v2,human
Spurion Analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Non-Invertible Selection Rules: Low-Order versus All-Order Zeros,"Motivated by recent progress in the spurion analysis of non-invertible selection rules (NISRs) arising from near-group fusion algebras, we further generalize the framework to a class of NISRs obtained from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolding of a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetry, denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. Many structural features are carried over: for instance, our labeling scheme enables systematic tracking of all couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks at arbitrary loop orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis provides a transparent understanding of both low-order and all-order zeros of couplings under radiative corrections. Furthermore, we examine the fate of low-order zeros when the fusion algebra is not faithfully realized -- a situation not captured by the vanilla argument of ``loop-induced groupification'' -- and formulate a conjecture on the related aspects of particle decoupling and effective theory. Finally, we discuss the low-order versus all-order zeros in Yukawa textures from the perspective of spurion analysis.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18972v1,human
Freeze-in and Freeze-out in Right-Handed Neutrino Extended MSSM with Seesaw,"We investigate the possibility of saturating the relic density bound with light higgsinos. When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low, right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the traditional freeze-out of higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a delay. We rule out such a scenario for all seesaw models as the lifetime of sterile neutrinos, produced over-abundantly via Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, exceeds the age of the universe and will contribute to the relic density.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18969v1,human
Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory,"A paradigmatic model, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618v1,human
Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem,"The absence of a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) constrains the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theta angle to be less than one part in ten billion, posing the Strong $CP$ problem. We revisit two classes of proposed solutions. First, we show that when $P$ or $CP$ is realized as a gauged discrete symmetry - as can arise in quantum gravity - the vacuum necessarily preserves $CP$, contrary to recent claims that discrete-symmetry solutions fail. Gauged discrete models face model-building challenges, such as avoiding contributions to the neutron EDM after spontaneous $P$ or $CP$ breaking, but in principle have no fundamental obstructions. Second, we critically examine recent arguments that the Strong $CP$ problem is illusory, demonstrating that a nonzero neutron EDM at finite $\barθ$ follows directly from well-understood QCD dynamics. Taken together, our results reinforce the reality of the Strong $CP$ problem and highlight gauged discrete-symmetry realizations of $P$ or $CP$ as plausible solutions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18951v1,human
The $B^+ \to K^+ ν\bar ν$ decay as a search for the QCD axion,"We reinterpret the $B^+ \to K^+ ν\bar ν$ measurement as a probe of the decay $B^+ \to K^+ a$, where $a$ denotes an axion or axion-like particle. This is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m_a^2$. While $q^2$ is reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a reconstructed variable, $q^2_{\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2_{\text{rec}}$ can be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone -- without relying on internal experimental inputs. Using this relation and publicly available efficiencies, we obtain the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, $|(F_V)_{sb}| \ge 0.9 \times 10^9$ GeV, improving the latest bound in the literature by an order of magnitude. We further show that the bound depends only marginally on the assumed value of the di-neutrino signal strength $μ_{ν{\barν}}$, whether fixed or floated. This establishes $B^+ \to K^+ ν\bar ν$ as a double probe -- of new short-distance physics in the $B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν$ amplitude, and of new light, elusive particles produced via $B^+ \to K^+ a$ -- the two probes working independently to an excellent approximation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18953v1,human
Muon trident process at far-forward LHC detectors,"The electromagnetic production of a dilepton pair in the muon - ion scattering, usually denoted muon trident process, is investigated considering the feasibility of studying processes induced by muons at LHC using its far-forward detectors. The total and differential cross - sections are estimated taking into account of the Bethe-Heitler and bremsstrahlung channels, and predictions for the event rates expected for muon - tungsten ($μW$) collisions at the LHC energies are presented. Our results indicate that the observation of the muon trident process is feasible at FASER$ν$. In particular, our results indicate that the electromagnetic production of $τ^+ τ^-$ pairs in the $μW$ scattering can, in principle, be observed for the first time ever at the LHC. In addition, we present our predictions for the production of QED bound states. Finally, results for the trident process at the FASER$ν$2 detector are also presented.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18943v1,human
NNLO QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized SIDIS,"We present the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pure QED and mixed QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Building on our previous NNLO QCD results, these corrections are crucial for improving the theoretical precision. The coefficient functions are derived within the QCD factorization framework using dimensional regularization, with consistent renormalization and mass factorization. A detailed phenomenological analysis shows that the NNLO QED and QCD$\otimes$QED terms enhance perturbative stability and reduce scale uncertainties. These results are essential for high-precision SIDIS predictions at future facilities such as the Electron-Ion Collider.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18872v1,human

Modelling $b\bar b H$ production for the LHC at 13.6 TeV,"We present new state-of-the-art predictions for Standard Model Higgs boson production in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b\bar bH$). Updated cross sections are computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group, including the use of the PDF4LHC21 set of parton distribution functions, with a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV. For the total inclusive cross section, we provide matched predictions of the massless five-flavour scheme (5FS) and the massive four-flavour scheme (4FS) at the fixed-order level. We further present recently obtained simulations matched with parton showers in both flavour schemes within the SM, and also discuss them in the context of potential BSM scenarios. In the massless scheme, we compare different NNLO+PS predictions obtained through the MiNNLOPS and GENEVA generators. In addition, the role of 4FS predictions is studied as a background to $HH$ searches, considering both the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa contributions to $b\bar bH$ production. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum to light-quark Yukawa couplings in the diphoton decay channel based on MiNNLOPS simulations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18815v1,human
Analysis note: measurement of thrust and track energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions at 91.2 GeV with DELPHI open data,"Recent theoretical developments, as well as experimental measurements at hadron collisions, have renewed interest in studying event shape variables in $e^+e^-$ collisions. We present a measurement of thrust and track-based energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions at center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, using newly released open data from the DELPHI experiment. The event shapes, measured with unprecedented resolution and precision, are compared to various Monte Carlo and analytic predictions. Leveraging DELPHI's unique detector geometry and reconstruction capabilities, the track energy-energy correlator measurement provides data with the highest angular resolution, offering critical inputs for precision tests of QCD in both collinear and back-to-back limits.

Charm-strange meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"We study charm-strange mesons, or $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons by focusing on their production by coalescence from a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Starting from the investigation of the transverse momentum distribution of both charm and strange quarks through transverse momentum distributions of $φ$ and $D^0$ mesons, we calculate the transverse momentum distributions and yields of $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons based on the coalescence model. We find that the yield and transverse momentum distribution of the $D_s$ meson agree well with the experimental measurements at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. We further evaluate the transverse momentum ratio between $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons, and investigate the role of light and strange quarks in the production of charmed mesons in heavy ion collisions. Finally, we calculate the transverse momentum distribution and yield of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a four-quark state, and compare to those of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a two-quark state.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18673v1,human
"Constraints on Attractor Models of Inflation and Reheating from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G Data","We analyze the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) data, focusing on their implications for attractor models of inflation. We compare systematically observational bounds with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($α$-Starobinsky) and T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with $α\lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($α= 1$) predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 - 10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95% confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility. T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $α\lesssim 11$ in these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $α$-attractors with monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum, demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 - 0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6 data. We also consider deformed E- and T-models, which allow significantly higher values of $n_s$ for low values of $α\simeq 1$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18656v1,human
"The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders","We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the ""tension"" and ""compatibility"" scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (<1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564v1,human
Towards a Post-Inflationary Composite Axion Model,"Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gauged'' $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the string-wall network.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18538v1,human
Heavy Neutral Lepton at Same-Sign Muon Collider,"We explore the discovery potential of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), motivated by models addressing the origin of neutrino masses, at the proposed high-energy same-sign muon collider known as $μ$TRISTAN. The study focuses on two complementary HNL-mediated signatures: (i) the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) channel $μ^+μ^+ \to W^+τ^+\barν_μ$ and (ii) the lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel $μ^{+}μ^{+} \to W^{+}W^{+}$. The LNV process is the muon analogue of inverse neutrinoless double beta decay and, if observed, would provide strong evidence for Majorana neutrinos, while the LFV process offers a novel probe of flavor-changing neutral currents in the lepton sector. At the $μ$TRISTAN collider with $\sqrt{s} \sim \mathcal{O}(10)~\text{TeV}$, the resulting sensitivity to the HNL mixing with muon and tau neutrinos, as a function of mass, can surpass current bounds from the measurements of electroweak precision observables over a broad mass range. In particular, for the mixing with muon neutrinos, the collider bound can improve by an order of magnitude for $5$-$10$ TeV HNLs.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18390v1,human
High-Quality Axion Models with the Anomalous $U(1)_X$ Gauge Symmetry,"We propose the generic high-quality axion models with anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and vector-like particles. We briefly review the gauge anomaly cancellations via the Green-Schwarz mechanism, study the breaking of the $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, as well as derive the Nambu-Goldstone boson, Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion, and axion decay constant in general. The high-dimensional operators, which break the $U(1)_{PQ}$ global symmetry, have dimension eleven or higher due to the anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, and thus the axion quality problem is solved. In particular, unlike the high-quality axion models with anomaly free $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we only need to introduce two pairs of vector-like particles. To be concrete, we present three specific models with two pairs of vector-like particles. We show that gauge anomalies in all three models can be canceled via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. To achieve gauge coupling unification, we need to introduce additional vector-like particles only in Model I. We find that gauge coupling unification is achieved at the unification scale around $10^{16}$ GeV with a relative error of less than 1\%. Notably, gauge coupling unification in Model II is achieved naturally with the smallest relative error of 0.1\%.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18306v1,human
Neutrino Dipole Portal,"The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions, and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions. The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18181v1,human
Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables,"We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by interconversion $χ_1χ_1 \to χ_2χ_2$ - determine the relic abundance analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $σ_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20 - 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster upper bounds $σ_{\rm{eff}}/m < 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and ``little red dots''; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains consistent with Lyman-$α$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and astrophysical requirements.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142v1,human
Solar Reflected Dark Matter under the Influence of Dark Magnetic Field,"The scattering of dark matter particles within the Sun's hot plasma can lead to acceleration of dark matter, producing a high-energy solar-reflected DM flux detectable in ground-based experiments. In the vector portal model, interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles are mediated by a hidden vector field--referred to as ``dark photon""--which kinetically mixes with the conventional photon through a small mixing angle. Furthermore, the solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon mixing, this simultaneously sources a ``dark magnetic field"". For sufficiently low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments aiming to probe dark matter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18028v1,human
Constraining a de Broglie-Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data,"This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$σ_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022v1,human
Three decades of FCNC studies in 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos: from $Z^\prime$-dominance to the alignment limit,"Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes play a prominent role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) due to their sensitivity to new physics at the TeV scale. Meson-antimeson transitions and rare meson decays provide stringent constraints on new physics through precision measurements of observables such as mass differences, CP asymmetries, and branching ratios. Extensions of the SM based on the $\text{SU}(3)_C \times \text{SU}(3)_L \times \text{U}(1)_N$ gauge group offer a compelling framework for flavor physics, as FCNC processes emerge inexorably at tree level due to the non-universal transformations of the quark families. Among its various realizations, the version incorporating right-handed neutrinos (331RHN) is the most phenomenologically viable. This review synthesizes three decades of theoretical developments in FCNC phenomenology within the 331RHN model, from early $Z^\prime$-dominated studies to the recent recognition of the decisive role played by the SM-like Higgs boson and the identification of the alignment limit. We demonstrate that viable parameter space spans orders of magnitude, from $m_{Z^\prime} \sim$ a few hundred GeV to $\sim 100$ TeV, depending critically on quark mixing parametrizations and scalar alignment configurations, with significant implications for experimental searches at current and future colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17979v1,human
Supersymmetry searches in CMS Run 2: A complete review,"The Run 2 data-taking period of the CERN Large Hadron Collider during years 2015-2018 provided about 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore supersymmetry (SUSY) across a wide range of experimental signatures. CMS responded with a broad and diverse search program, carrying out dozens of analyses that probed a multitude of final states and systematically explored different regions of the SUSY parameter space. No significant deviations from standard model predictions were observed, and the results were used for constraining the SUSY landscape.

Resonance phenomena in vortex-antivortex collisions,"In this work, we provide a full map of scattering scenarios between a Nielsen-Olesen vortex and antivortex.

This structure is due to the energy transfer mechanism triggered by a quasinormal mode, specifically the Feshbach resonant mode, hosted by the vortex.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17964v1,human
Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA,"Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967v1,human
Branching ratios for Higgs-mixed scalars at the GeV scale from hadronisation models with conservation laws,"We investigate the decay modes of a CP-even scalar boson $φ$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs boson, focusing on the mass range between 2 GeV and $2 m_τ$. Starting from a higher-order perturbative calculation of the inclusive decays $φ\to gg$ and $φ\to s\bar{s}$, we employ a hadronisation model to obtain predictions for individual hadronic final states. Our hadronisation model is based on the Herwig cluster model, but incorporates various conservation laws to determine the allowed final states and their respective weights. The model includes two tunable parameters, which we determine using dispersion relation results at $m_φ= 2$ GeV, enabling extrapolation to higher masses. Our predictions show that two-particle hadronic final states like $π^+ π^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ dominate over $μ^+ μ^-$ for $m_φ$ near 2 GeV, suggesting promising targets for future experimental searches.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17961v1,human
Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles,"The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $β$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $β$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $β\sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $β\sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956v1,human
Probing the Higgs Portal to a Strongly-Interacting Dark Sector at the FCC-ee,"This work explores exotic signatures from confining dark sectors that may arise in the e+e- collision mode at the Future Circular Collider. Assuming the Higgs boson mediates the interaction between the Standard Model and the dark sector, dark quarks can be produced in e+e- collisions. The ensuing strong dynamics may lead to semi-visible jet final states, containing both visible and invisible particles. We investigate semi-visible jets with different fractions of invisible states, and enriched in leptons and photons. When the invisible component is large, selections based on kinematic features, such as the missing energy in the event, already provide good signal-to-background discrimination. For smaller invisible fractions, the reduced missing energy makes these signals more similar to Standard Model events, and we therefore employ a graph neural network jet tagger exploiting differences in jet substructure. This machine learning strategy improves sensitivity and enhances the discovery prospects of Higgs boson-induced semi-visible jets at the Future Circular Collider. Our results show that the proposed strategy can effectively probe a wide parameter space for the models considered, and a variety of signatures, constraining the Higgs boson exotic branching ratios into dark quarks at the permille-level.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17675v1,human
Prospects for Measuring $CP$-Violation in $B_s^0 \rightarrow φμ^+μ^-$ via Time-Dependent Angular Analysis,"This work investigates the prospects for performing a time-dependent angular analysis of $B_s^0 \rightarrow φμ^+μ^-$ decays at hadron colliders, and introduces new optimised angular observables associated with $B_s^0$-mixing in the decay rate. The time-dependent normalised decay rate and corresponding probability density function is presented both for when the flavour of the $B_s^0$ meson at production is tagged and when it is untagged. The normalised angular terms linked to $B_s^0$-mixing in the tagged (untagged) case are denoted $\mathcal{Z}_i$ ($\mathcal{H}_i$), and their optimised counterparts as $Q_i$ ($\mathcal{M}_i$).   The expected sensitivities of these observables at the end of Run 3, Run 4, and Run 5 of the LHC are determined using pseudoexperiments generated with a decay-time resolution, background level, and signal yield similar to those reported by the LHCb collaboration. It is found that all observables can be extracted with Run 3 statistics, and that the $\mathcal{H}_i$ and $\mathcal{Z}_i$ observables have similar sensitivity, despite the former being suppressed by mixing terms. Moreover, the angular observables only accessible via flavour tagging, such as the equivalent of $P_5^{\prime}$ in the $B^0_s$ system, are found to exhibit sensitivities comparable to current measurements in $B^0 \rightarrow K^{\ast 0} μ^+μ^-$ decays once Run 5 datasets are available. Fits to the observables to extract the Wilson coefficients show a significant increase in precision when either the observables accessible via time-dependent analysis, or flavour tagging, are included. A marked increase in sensitivity to $CP$-violating short-distance effects is observed for a subset of the new optimised $M_i$ and $Q_i$ observables.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17646v1,human
Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests,"We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlation"" is fully consistent with $\sin^2θ^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2θ^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17583v2,human
Colour coherence in small collision systems,"The observation of collectivity in collisions of small systems has constituted a challenge for the heavy-ion community for over a decade now. The absence of jet quenching in those systems presents an apparent contradiction to the presence of an azimuthal anisotropy of high-$p_\perp$ particles. In the present work, we investigate the role of colour coherence in this puzzle. For that, we use the \textsc{Jewel} Monte Carlo model in its latest version, which includes effects of colour coherence in the jet-medium interactions. We then compare the two scenarios, with and without colour coherence, and quantify the effect on hadron and jet $R_{AA}$ as well as on high-$p_\perp$ $v_2$. The results indicate that, although coherence effects do account for an increase in $R_{AA}$, they do not affect $v_2$ to the same extent. Using hydrodynamic profiles generated with \textit{Trajectum} we compare O+O and Pb+Pb collisions at the same charged particle multiplicity and find that the nuclear modification factors are the same in both systems despite their different shapes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17570v1,human
Production of gravitational waves by inflationary transitions in aligned natural inflation,"The original axion natural inflation model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio exceeding experimental limits. Conversely, in aligned axion inflation, inflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of the two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal direction. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be tested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the possibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition characterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate that the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We explore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This mechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or axion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent power spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by the duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may peak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17556v1,human
Electromagnetic form factors and structure of the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark from lattice QCD,"We present the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors of the exotic tetraquark $T_{bb} \ (bb \bar u \bar d)$ with quantum numbers $I( J^P ) = 0( 1^+ )$. The extracted form factors encode information about its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the magnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks. Our results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light antidiquark $[\bar u \bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge radius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined charge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying threshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge form factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single CLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of approximately $a \approx0.064 \ \mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_π\approx 290 \ \mathrm{MeV}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17549v2,human
"Electromagnetic properties of the $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners in a molecular configuration","We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the axial-vector molecular states $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$, which are used to model the charmed states $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. To our knowledge, this presents the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments for these specific molecular configurations. Employing the QCD light-cone sum rule method with molecular-type interpolating currents, we compute these moments and perform a detailed flavor decomposition to reveal the internal distribution of the electromagnetic charge and spin. Our results demonstrate that the light up and down quarks dominate the electromagnetic response, with negligible contributions from the heavy quarks. The $D^* K$ and $B^* K$ states exhibit negative quadrupole moments and slightly oblate charge distributions, whereas the $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ states possess positive quadrupole moments and prolate distributions, with significant contributions from the strange quark. The predicted moments provide benchmarks for lattice QCD calculations and are testable through their influence on radiative transitions and photo- and electro-production observables at high-luminosity facilities, offering crucial insights into the internal structure and nature of these axial-vector states.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17477v2,human
The Dark Matters at ICRC 2025,"The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly \emph{multimessenger}, combining $γ$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP candidates -- axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic relics -- are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the next decisive advances are likely to come.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17473v1,human
The inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion in soft-virtual approximation at fourth order in QCD,"We present precise results for the inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC considering state-of-the-art fourth-order results in perturbative QCD arising from the dominant soft and virtual gluon emissions. Utilizing four-loop QCD results for the gluon-form factor, the splitting function and related anomalous dimensions, we study the effects of threshold enhanced soft gluon emissions and estimate their impact on the total cross-section at the fourth order. Our study highlights the role of these higher-order contributions in improving the perturbative convergence and in significantly reducing the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties. The results provide strong evidence for the perturbative stability and reliability of Higgs boson cross-section predictions at the LHC, thereby reinforcing the robustness of theoretical inputs in precision Higgs phenomenology. We also provide cross-section predictions using a large set of available parton distribution functions and show that, together with the value of the strong coupling $α_s(m_Z)$, they cause the largest residual uncertainty for the Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17413v1,human
High Quality QCD Axion in the Standard Model,"Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem, the ad hoc introduced global Peccei-Quinn symmetry suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem known as the quality problem. In this Letter, we show that the discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$ motivated from the internal structure of the Standard Model can naturally predict a high-quality axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17370v1,human
A dispersive approach to the CP conserving $K\toπ\ell^+\ell^-$ radiative decays,"We reconsider the constraints on the form factors $W_+ (s)$ and $W_S (s)$, describing the radiative decay modes $K^+\toπ^+ \ell^+\ell^-$ and $K_S\toπ^0 \ell^+\ell^-$, associated with the general properties of analyticity and unitarity. Starting from the simple consideration of the asymptotic behaviours of the two combinations $2 W_+ (s) - W_S (s)$ and $W_+ (s) + W_S (s)$, we derive a minimal pair of dispersive representations which involves only two free parameters. An important input for these representations consists of the $K\to3π$ decay amplitudes, for which we use a set of solutions of the Khuri-Treiman equations obtained recently. These solutions provide an extrapolation from the physical $K\to3π$ decay region up to the resonant $Kπ\toππ$ scattering regions. We show that the experimental energy dependence of $|W_+|^2$ can be well reproduced and that the sign of $W_+$ is unambiguously determined. We also show that the yet unknown $Δ{I}=1/2$ part of the $K_S\to π^+ π^- π^0$ amplitude can be determined from the value of $W_+(0) + W_S(0)$. The possibility of fixing the sign of $W_S(0)$ using experimental data on both $|W_+|^2$ and $|W_S|^2$ is discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17316v1,human
A radiative seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry,"We propose a two-loop neutrino mass model where fermionic and bosonic dark matter (DM) candidates are simultaneously connected to the neutrinos. But the fermionic DM candidate is favored compared to the bosonic one due to generating the fermionic DM mass at one-loop level. In order to obtain our desired Lagrangian and Higgs potential, we introduce a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible fusion rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The fusion rule forbids the mass of DM candidate at tree level but its mass is generated at one-loop level where the DM mass term dynamically violates the fusion rule. After that, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level where a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry is still remained. The symmetry assures the stability of our DM candidate. The non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry plays a role in forbidding the interactions between the SM particles and heavier fermions $X_R$ and an isospin singlet inert scalar boson $S_0$ that run in the DM mass loop, in addition to reduction our free parameters that leads to our predictions for lepton sector. We perform $χ^2$ numerical analysis for the lepton masses, mixing angles, and phases, and we show several predictions for NH and IH. Then, we demonstrate our lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and the relic density of the DM candidate fixing the best fit point of the lepton sector.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17292v1,human
Axion inflation in the regime of homogeneous backreaction,"We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced in models of axion inflation coupled to gauge fields. Achieving a detectable signal at Pulsar Timing Array, astrometry, or interferometer frequencies requires a sufficiently strong amplification of the gauge fields, at a level that induces significant backreaction on the inflaton background dynamics. Numerical studies based on the approximation of homogeneous backreaction (i.e., neglecting inhomogeneities of the inflaton field) exhibit oscillations in the inflaton velocity, with corresponding peaks in the SGWB spectrum. The most recent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing examples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and the breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density perturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining examples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that remains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout inflation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17207v1,human
Radiative lepton model in a non-invertible fusion rule,"We propose a radiatively induced lepton mass model introducing a $Z_2$ gauging $Z_5$ fusion rule. In our framework, the charged-lepton mass matrix is generated at one loop level via dynamical breaking of the fusion rule. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level without breaking the fusion rule. As a direct consequence of the loop induced charged lepton masses, we can also consider lepton flavor violations, electron and muon $g-2$, and charged-lepton electric dipole moments that come into our valid phenomenological discussion. Then, we perform numerical analysis and show some interesting tendency on Dirac CP phase, two Majorana phases, charged-lepton electric dipole moments and the neutrinoless double beta decay, all of which depends on their arguments where we fix the absolute values of our free parameters in order to satisfy experimental data of the lepton masses and mixing angles.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17156v1,human
Dynamic Lasing of Axion Clusters,"We examine high-density axion clusters under gravitational compression.

Bayesian inference of the magnetic component of quark-gluon plasma,"The chromo-magnetic monopoles (CMM), emergent topological excitations of non-Abelian gauge fields carrying chromo-magnetic charge, have long been postulated to play an important role in the vacuum confinement of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the deconfinement transition at temperature $T_c\approx 160\rm MeV$, as well as the strongly coupled nature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While such CMMs have been found to provide solutions for challenging puzzles from heavy-ion collision measurements, they were typically introduced as model assumptions in the past. Here we show how their very existence can be determined and their abundance extracted in a data-driven way for the first time. Using the \textsc{cujet3} framework for calculations of jet energy loss and analyzing a comprehensive experimental data set for nuclear modification factor ($R_{\mathrm{AA}}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of high-transverse-momentum hadrons, the fraction of CMMs in the QGP is obtained by Bayesian inference and is found to be substantial in the $1\sim 2 T_c$ region. The posterior CMM fraction is further validated by excellent agreement with additional data and is also shown to predict QGP transport properties quantitatively consistent with the state-of-the-art knowledge.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16838v1,human
A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity,"A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current primarily dissipates the axion energy at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with low conductivity, e.g. $σ= 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the axion energy is dissipated mainly inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the dissipated power $P$ is estimated as $P \simeq 2.8\times 10^{-28}\text{W} g_γ^2 \left(L/100\text{cm}\right)\left(R/2\text{cm}\right)^2 \left(m_a/10^{-4}\text{eV}\right) \left(B/10\text{T}\right)^2\left(10/ε\right) \left(ρ_a/0.3\text{GeVcm}^{-3}\right)$, with $σ= 10^{-3}$eV, radius $R$, length $L$, electric permittivity $ε= 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $ρ_a$, where $g_γ(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_γ(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. Using an LC circuit appropriately tuned to a quality factor $Q = 10^6$, the signal-to-noise ratio at low temperature $100$mK and observation time $60$sec. is so large $\sim 10$ that the detection of dark matter axions is feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746v1,human
Neutrino Oscillation Prospects with a Dual-Baseline Beam from BNL to SNOLAB and SURF,"The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a next-generation accelerator primarily designed to study the internal structure of nucleons through high-precision electron-hadron collisions. In this work, we explore the feasibility of employing a 1 MW fraction of the EIC proton beam to generate a high-intensity GeV-scale neutrino beam for long-baseline oscillation studies. We have simulated proton-target interactions and optimize the resulting neutrino fluxes for water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) detectors located at distinct baselines of 900 km and at 2900 km. Oscillation analyses performed with GLoBES show that extended baselines allow access to multiple oscillation maxima, significantly enhancing sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The study also examines the interplay between matter effects and the intrinsic CP violating phase in shaping observable asymmetries. These results suggest that the EIC proton beam could provide a novel and complementary source for precision neutrino physics, extending the scientific reach of the EIC program.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16711v1,human
"Semileptonic decay and form factors of $Ω_b^- \rightarrow Ω_c^0\,e\,\bar{ν_e}$","We investigate the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay $Ω_b^- \rightarrow Ω_c^0\,e\,\bar{ν_e}$ within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (HCQM). The ground state masses of the involved baryons are evaluated by numerically solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schrödinger equation, incorporating both hyper-Coulomb and linear confinement potentials along with spin-dependent interactions. The Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory (HQET) form factors are computed up to the subleading order, incorporating $1/m_Q$ corrections that account for finite mass effects beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit. These form factors are then employed to analyse the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rate via helicity formalism. Our results for the decay width and branching ratio are compared with those from various theoretical approaches.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16529v2,human
The deep-MOND limit -- a study in Primary vs secondary predictions,"In default of a fundamental MOND theory -- a FUNDAMOND -- I advocate that, alongside searching for one, we should try to identify predictions that follow from wide classes of MOND theories, if not necessarily from all. In particular, predictions that follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- ``primary predictions'' -- are shared by all MOND theories, and are especially valuable. Such predictions permit us to test the MOND paradigm itself, or at least large parts of it, without yet having a FUNDAMOND. Concentrating on the deep-MOND limit, I discuss examples of either type of predictions. For some examples of primary predictions, I demonstrate how they follow from the basic tenets (which I first formulate). I emphasize that even predictions that pertain to the deep-MOND limit - namely, those that concern gravitating systems that have low accelerations everywhere -- require the full set of MOND tenets, including the existence of a Newtonian limit close to the deep-MOND regime. This is because Newtonian dynamics is a unique theory that all MOND theories must tend to in the limit of high accelerations, and it strongly constrains aspects of the deep-MOND regime, if the transition between the limits is fast enough, which is one of the MOND tenets.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16520v1,human
Determination of proton PDF uncertainties with Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"We present an analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC approach naturally implements Bayes' theorem and thus provides a means to directly sample the underlying probability distribution - in this case the probability distribution of the PDF parameters. This allows for a straightforward propagation of the resulting uncertainties into any PDF-dependent observable, preserving their simple probabilistic interpretation. In our analysis we include a broad set of deep inelastic scattering data from HERA, BCDMS and NMC experiments along with the Drell-Yan, $W$ and $Z$ boson data from LHC and Tevatron experiments, which combined with theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD allow for realistic determination of PDFs. The main focus of this analysis is to explore alternative methods for PDF uncertainty estimation that are more firmly grounded in statistical principles. We show that the flexibility of the Bayes framework, allowing e.g. to account for non-Gaussianity or inconsistencies of data sets, is crucial to extract realistic uncertainties when such assumptions are not fulfilled. We also demonstrate that MCMC allows one to determine the $Δχ^2$ value corresponding to a given confidence level in the sample, which can in turn be used as a statistically well-founded tolerance criterion used in the Hessian method, thus addressing one of its main long-standing drawbacks.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16158v1,human
A new determination of $α_s (M_τ^2)$ and higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $τ$ decays,"We employ \textit{Levin-type sequence transformations} to accelerate the convergence of the perturbative fixed-order expansion of the QCD correction $δ^{(0)}$ in terms of the strong coupling $α_s$, and of the inverted series expressing $α_s$ in powers of $δ^{(0)}$. The method efficiently resums the divergent inverted series, yielding a stable and self-consistent determination of the strong coupling at the $τ$ mass scale. It also provides reliable estimates of higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $τ$ decays, consistent with existing results. We find $α_s^{\text{Levin-FOPT}} = 0.3159 \pm 0.0018 \, \pm 0.0023 \, $, and predict $c_{5,1} = 269^{+47}_{-45}, \quad c_{6,1} = 3185^{+117}_{-279}, \quad c_{7,1} = (1.9^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) \times 10^4.$ Our results demonstrate that Levin-type transformations provide an efficient framework for analyzing asymptotic perturbative series and improving the extraction of $α_s(M_τ^2)$ from hadronic $τ$ decays.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16119v1,human
Neutrino Mass Induced $n$-$\overline{n}$ Oscillation,"The Georgi-Glashow model is the simplest possible attempt at grand unification. However, due to its particle content, it preserves a global $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, where $B$ and $L$ are baryon and lepton numbers, respectively. It thus leaves neutrinos massless just as in the Standard Model. Extensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that break lepton number by two units, i.e., scenarios with $|ΔL|=2$ operator(s), naturally generate potentially viable Majorana neutrino masses. Consequently, $B-L$ breaking via the same dynamics that yields $|ΔL| = 2$ interactions unavoidably induces $|ΔB| = 2$ transitions, leading to intriguing processes such as neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\overline{n}$) oscillation. We demonstrate this intrinsic connection between neutrino mass generation and $n$-$\overline{n}$ oscillation within tree-level seesaw mechanisms of the Type I, II, and III varieties, as well as in the one-loop and two-loop radiative neutrino mass models. Our study exhausts the simplest possible extensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that yield realistic neutrino masses and mixing parameters and, in the process, induce $n$-$\overline{n}$ oscillation.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16103v1,human
Diabatic Dynamical Diquark Model of Hidden-Strangeness Tetraquarks,"We generalize our recent analysis of hidden-strangeness tetraquarks within the dynamical diquark model from its adiabatic form (in which each state is described solely by a diquark-antidiquark potential) to its diabatic form (which incorporates effects of di-hadron thresholds upon the states). We tabulate all relevant thresholds and compute the di-hadron content of each predicted state. Our results produce no particular hidden-strange tetraquark candidate whose structure is dominated by di-hadron structure, in contrast to the charm sector, where many exotic states are strongly associated with such thresholds. Multiple states above 2~GeV with peculiar decay properties, including $φ(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and $η(2370)$, continue to serve as excellent hidden-strange tetraquark candidates.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15844v1,human
Impact of neutrino decays on the Cosmic Neutrino Background anisotropies,"The anisotropies of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$ν$B) offer an ideal tool to test non-standard neutrino interactions, since they directly trace the perturbations in the neutrino distribution function. Here, we study how invisible neutrino decays impact the C$ν$B anisotropies, in a framework where neutrinos decay non-relativistically to dark radiation and lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. For this purpose, we perform the first implementation of such a late-time neutrino decay scenario within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver, and compute the C$ν$B angular power spectra from the Boltzmann hierarchy solutions for a range of lifetimes and decay channels. We find that neutrino decays leave very strong signatures on the C$ν$B angular spectra, about two orders of magnitude larger than on the CMB angular spectra, particularly for lifetimes comparable to the age of the Universe. We show that a future polarized tritium target run of the PTOLEMY experiment, with sufficient counting statistics to measure just the first $\sim 15$ multipoles of the neutrino sky map, could test neutrino decay models that remain undetectable with CMB data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15818v1,human
New Elementary Operator for Kaon Photoproduction on the Nucleon and Nuclei,"A new elementary operator for kaon photoproduction on the nucleon and nuclei has been developed within a Feynman diagrammatic framework. By fitting the unknown coupling strengths at the electromagnetic and hadronic vertices of the baryon resonances to all available experimental data across the six isospin channels, the model achieves excellent agreement with the data. The operator includes 26 nucleon resonances in the $KΛ$ channels and 17 additional $Δ$ resonances in the $KΣ$ channels. For applications to nuclear reactions, such as hypernuclear photoproduction, the operator is formulated in Pauli space, allowing a straightforward implementation of the nonrelativistic approximation. Several alternative forms for expressing the operator output are proposed. In one of them, the spin operators and photon polarization vectors are separated from the operator, since both are frame dependent, thereby enhancing its versatility in nuclear applications.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15482v1,human
Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves,"We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15460v1,human
Convergence of Heavy-Flavor PDFs at Small x and Its Impact on Future ep Colliders,"We present the first quantitative demonstration of the statistical convergence of heavy-flavor parton distribution functions at small x across modern NNLO global fits. Using the latest NNPDF4.0, CT18, and MSHT20 sets, we find a maximal relative deviation of 16.8 percent at x = 1e-6 and Q = 100 GeV, corresponding to nearly a factor-of-two improvement over the approximately 30 percent spread in pre-2013 determinations. This convergence, stabilized by consistent alpha_s and scale treatments, marks a transition of the heavy-flavor sector into a statistically controlled regime of small-x QCD. We further show that this precision directly reduces PDF-driven uncertainties in heavy-quark electroproduction at future ep colliders (LHeC and FCC-eh) by about a factor of two and enhances the theoretical stability of leptophilic new-physics searches such as a neutral Z_l gauge boson. These findings establish a link between the precision frontier of QCD and the discovery potential of next-generation lepton-hadron facilities.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15427v1,human
Study of $P$ and $CP$ symmetries in $Ξ^+_c\rightarrow Ξ^-π^+π^+$ at electron-positron collider,"Symmetry studies represent one of the most promising frontiers in particle physics research. This investigation focuses on exploring $P$ and $CP$ symmetries in the charm system through the measurement of asymmetry decay parameters in the three-body decay of $Ξ_c^{+}$. Incorporating electron and positron beam polarization effects and utilizing the helicity formalism, we characterize the decay of $Ξ_c^{+}$ and its secondary hyperons through asymmetry decay parameters. The complete angular distribution formula for these decays has been systematically derived. Our study evaluates the sensitivity of the asymmetry parameters for the $Ξ_c^{+} \to Ξ^{-}π^{+}π^{+}$ decay channel under various data sample sizes and beam polarization scenarios. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for future experimental studies at the STCF, providing valuable insights for symmetry investigations in the charm sector.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15320v1,human
Effects of Radiative Corrections on Starobinsky Inflation,"We analyze radiative corrections to the Starobinsky model of inflation arising from self-interactions of the inflaton, and from its Yukawa couplings, $y$, to matter fermions, and dimensionful trilinear couplings, $κ$, to scalar fields, which could be responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation. The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations, $n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions in the Einstein frame: $y < 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} < 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} < y < 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} < T_{\rm RH} < 2.8 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker constraints. Planck data also imply a constraint on a trilinear inflaton coupling to light scalars in the Einstein frame: $κ\leq 4 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$, corresponding to $T_{\rm RH} \leq 4.2 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$.

Multi-species Dark Matter with Warmth and Randomness,"We present a general analytic framework for the evolution of cosmic structure in multi-species dark matter models that simultaneously incorporates finite velocity dispersion and Poisson fluctuations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary numbers of dark matter components with distinct mass fractions, velocity distributions, and number densities -- ranging from cold particles to warm species and sparse populations such as primordial black holes or solitons. The framework is based on solving a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, whose solution is obtained by solving Volterra integral equations. We provide an efficient algorithm to solve for the total, as well as inter- and intra-species power spectra. Worked examples with two-component mixtures illustrate how isocurvature (initially Poisson) and adiabatic spectra evolve differently depending on the properties of the warm or sparse fraction. This evolution is controlled by the free-streaming and Jeans scales, and the results match analytic estimates and $N$-body simulations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15046v1,human
Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments,"New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($ν$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15023v2,human
Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI,"We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $Λ$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $>3σ$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3σ$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14941v1,human
Transverse momentum dependent gluon density in a proton at low $x$ in the Laplace transform method,"We investigate the gluon distribution in a proton at very low $x$, both integrated and transverse momentum dependent, using the Laplace transform technique. By accounting for leading and main next-to-leading contributions, we derive compact analytical expressions for the gluon densities valid in the asymptotic limit $x \to 0$. Our results closely match those from other analytical and numerical approaches, with the main advantage being the simplicity of the expressions, which capture the essential features of more complex calculations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14678v1,human
An insight into the rare $Z\rightarrow b \bar{b}γ$ at the HL-LHC,"Studies at the $Z$-pole have played an important role in developing our understanding of the Standard Model (SM). Continuing the explorations in this regime, we consider the possibility of the production of two $b$-quarks and a photon in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. While such a final state is possible in the SM by means of the process $Z\rightarrow b\bar b$ decay with a radiated photon, the focus is on extracting its possible origins due to beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. The signal topology can be broadly identified as $Z\rightarrow Φγ\rightarrow b\bar bγ$, where $ Φ$ can either be a spin-0 or spin-2 state with a mass less than that of the $Z$ boson.The analysis is characterised by two relatively low $p_T$ jets that are required to be $b$-tagged jets and an isolated photon. The study provides a quantitative framework for their identification and highlights the potential challenges associated with this final state. A range of machine learning architectures is employed to demonstrate the stability and reliability of the discriminating variables. This study highlights the importance of the low-$p_T$ objects in searches at the HL-LHC, hence the need to pay special attention to their identification and efficiencies.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14597v1,human
Exclusive $J/Ψ$ Production and Gluon GPDs Effects,"Study of exclusive photoproduction of $J/Ψ$ mesons was carried out in a factorization approach. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for gluons, which play an important role here, are constructed using the double distribution representation. The obtained cross sections of $J/Ψ$ production in a wide energy range are in good agreement with the experiment. The spin asymmetries in the $J/Ψ$ production were estimated. These calculations were extended to the of $J/Ψ$ mesons production in ultraperipherical $pp$ collisions. It was shown a good agreement of our results with the LHCb data. Predictions have been made for the NICA energy range. The model results can be used to study the gluon GPDs in future colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14572v1,human
Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology,"Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14552v2,human
ALP couplings to muons and electrons: a comprehensive analysis of supernova bounds,"We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) through interactions with electrons and muons, both of which have a non-negligible abundance in the SN plasma. We identify and calculate six significant ALP-production channels, two of which are loop-level processes involving photons. We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron and ALP-muon parameter spaces. Those include the bounds on anomalous cooling, energy deposition, decay into photons, diffuse gamma rays, and the 511 keV line. Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to electrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption processes. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using three state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation codes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10).",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14469v1,human
Model Independence of Effective Field Theory,The use of effective field theory offers a systematic way to improve calculations of nuclear reactions and the properties of atomic nuclei.

Effects of Subnucleonic Fluctuations on the Longitudinal Dynamics of Heavy-Ion Collisions,"It is well understood that subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions have an important impact on the creation of long-range correlations in the transverse plane. This is also true for the creation of particle correlations along the beam direction, which can be measured in particle detectors, e.g. through longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity structures in Pb+Pb collisions using a hybrid model connecting the 3D resolved {\Dipper} initial state model to a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the (sub-)nucleon level and present the effects of their inclusion on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, focusing in this proceedings paper on charged hadron multiplicities, baryon stopping, directed flow and flow decorrelation. We find remarkable agreement to the experimental data regarding directed flow and the rapidity resolved charge particle multiplicity.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14118v2,human
Production cross sections of charm-beauty mesons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC,"In this work, we calculate the production cross sections of the 1S and 1P states of the $B_{c}$ meson for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus colliding beam experiments at LHC and RHIC. We provide estimates for the Au nucleus at RHIC energies and for the Pb and Xe nuclei at LHC energies. Previous estimates of these cross sections have ignored quark anti-quark annihilation diagrams and are confined to S states for Pb and Au nuclei. The cross sections of the P states are also equally important as these states lie below the BD threshold and cascade into $B_{c}$ ground states with 100\% probability. In addition to calculating the $p_{T}$, rapidity, and pseudo-rapidity distributions of the cross sections, we also determine the nuclear modification factors $R_{pA}$ and $R_{AA}$ for $A=\textrm{Pb}$, $\textrm{Xe}$, and $\textrm{Au}$. The results provide a baseline for the upcoming experimental studies of $B_{c}$ mesons in pp, pA, and AA collisions in RUN III of LHC and could help develop experimental strategies for identification of hitherto undiscovered states of the $B_{c}$ meson.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14107v1,human
The Good Qualities of the Weak Axion,"The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model motivates the existence of a good quality weak axion $a_W$, associated with the spontaneous breaking of $B\!+\!L$. Its anomalous couplings and tiny mass, generated from electroweak instantons, render $a_W$ photophobic. We find that the strongest bound on the associated decay constant, $f_W$, stems from a loop-induced coupling to electrons, leading to $f_W \gtrsim 1000$ TeV from stellar cooling. Spontaneous breaking of the abelian ${B\!+\!L}$ symmetry induces proton decay via higher dimensional operators controlled by a new physics scale, $Λ$. Existing Super-Kamiokande limits on these decay channels constrain the new physics scale to be $Λ\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The characteristic channel $p\to e^+ a_W$ and other possible operators mediating interactions with the Standard Model fields yield signals which are not detectable within the allowed parameter space. Future proton decay searches at the next-generation of neutrino experiments offer the most promising avenues to test the good qualities of the weak axion paradigm.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14104v1,human
Chiral spin symmetry,"We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge and of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the vacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies that the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark condensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are not directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with chirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining electric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature T_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears suggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a very smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has been further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy density, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as N_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We have analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above T_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid. When N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the three-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally symmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the stringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the overlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark ""mesons"" with a very small mean free path.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14084v1,human
Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies,"We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature: following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization. Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability as a description of the early universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021v1,human
Prospects for Exploring Non-Standard Neutrino Properties with Argon-Based CEvNS Experiments,"Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a powerful framework for testing the Standard Model (SM) and searching for new physics at low energies. In this work, we examine the prospects for argon-based CEvNS experiments at stopped-pion sources to perform precision measurements of weak interactions and probe non-standard neutrino properties. Our study focused on the CENNS-10 and CENNS-750 detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Coherent Captain Mills (CCM) detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the proposed PIP2-BD detector at Fermilabs Facility for Dark Matter Discovery (F2D2). Using realistic neutrino fluxes and detector configurations corresponding to these facilities, we evaluate event rates and sensitivities to a range of observables. Within the SM, argon-based CEvNS detectors enable precision tests of electroweak parameters, including the weak mixing angle, at momentum transfers well below the electroweak scale. We also investigate the sensitivity of these experiments to neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as the magnetic moment and effective charge radius, as well as to possible non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks. Together, these studies highlight the potential of argon-based CEvNS experiments as a clean and versatile platform for precision exploration of non-standard neutrino properties.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14015v1,human
Isospin-based EWP-tree Relations,"In 1998, it was shown that, if flavor SU(3) symmetry [SU(3)$_F$] is assumed in charmless $B \to PP$ decays ($P$ is a light pseudoscalar meson), some reduced matrix elements involving electroweak penguin (EWP) operators are related to those involving tree operators. Similarly, EWP diagrams are related to tree diagrams. These SU(3)$_F$ EWP-tree relations were recently used in global analyses of $B \to PP$ decays. They have also been used over the years in analyses of the $B \to πK$ puzzle, even though the $B \to πK$ amplitudes are related by isospin symmetry [SU(2)$_I$], and not the full SU(3)$_F$. In this paper, we show that, even if only SU(2)$_I$ is assumed, there are still EWP-tree relations. In $ΔS=0$ decays, these relations are similar to those of SU(3)$_F$, and can be used to take into account the EWP contributions in the extraction of the CP phase $α$ from $B \to ππ$ decays. In $ΔS=1$ decays, the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations are quite different from those of SU(3)$_F$; when these are used to analyze the $B \to πK$ puzzle, one now finds a 4-5$σ$ discrepancy with the SM, much larger than what was previously found. We argue that, if one analyzes a set of hadronic $B$ decays whose amplitudes are related by isospin, one must use the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations for that set of decays in the analysis.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13969v1,human
Light new physics and the $\boldsymbolτ$ lepton dipole moments: prospects at Belle II,"While electron and muon dipole moments are well-established precision probes of physics beyond the Standard Model, it is notoriously challenging to test realistic New-Physics (NP) scenarios for the $τ$ lepton. Constructing suitable asymmetries in $e^+e^-\toτ^+τ^-$ has emerged as a promising such avenue, providing access to the electric and magnetic dipole moment once a polarized electron beam is available, e.g., with the proposed polarization upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. However, this interpretation relies on an effective-field-theory (EFT) argument that only applies if the NP scale is large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this Letter we address the consequences of the asymmetry measurements in the case of light NP, using light spin-0 and spin-1 bosons as test cases, to show how results can again be interpreted as constraints on dipole moments, albeit in a model-dependent manner, and how the decoupling to the EFT limit proceeds in these cases. In particular, we observe that the imaginary parts generated by light new particles can yield non-vanishing asymmetries even without electron polarization, presenting opportunities for NP searches that can be realized already with present data at Belle II.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13966v1,human
Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves,"Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957v1,human
Positivity and partial wave unitarity bounds on ALP theories via amplitude methods,"We derive the complete set of partial wave unitarity bounds on the most general Axion-Like Particle (ALP) effective interactions up to dimension 8 in the limit of large center-of-mass energy. Exploiting a recently developed formalism based on spinor-helicity techniques, we discuss the unitarity bounds for $N \to M$ (with $N, M \geq 2$) scattering amplitudes that can be relevant for ALP searches at colliders or in a variety of rare processes. Moreover, we compute positivity bounds on ALP interactions, emphasizing their complementarity with partial wave unitarity bounds. As a byproduct, we show that our results can be used to infer new positivity constraints in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13953v1,human
Decoherence in high energy collisions as renormalization group flow,"The unification of quantum information science and collider physics is opening a new frontier in high-energy experiments, making a systematic understanding of decoherence a critical challenge. We present a framework to systematically compute spin decoherence from final-state radiation by combining soft-collinear effective theory and open quantum system techniques. We demonstrate that the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the final-state spin density matrix constitutes a quantum channel, where the RG flow parameter, rather than time, drives a Markovian loss of quantum information. Our approach incorporates explicit detector resolution parameters, allowing a direct connection between experimental capabilities and the preservation of quantum coherence. Applying this formalism to a fermion pair ($f\bar{f}$) in the high-energy limit with QED-like final-state radiation, we provide the first systematically RG-improved prediction for decoherence as a function of experimental resolution, revealing the underlying decoherence mechanism to be a phase-flip channel. This work establishes an essential theoretical tool for future precision measurements of quantum phenomena in high-energy collisions and offers a new perspective on the interplay between RG flow and decoherence of open quantum systems.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13951v1,human
"Large Neutrino ""Collider""","We propose using current and future large-volume neutrino telescopes as ``Large Neutrino Colliders"" (L$ν$Cs) to explore TeV-scale physics beyond the Standard Model. Cosmic neutrinos with energies above 100 PeV colliding with nucleons in the detector reach center-of-mass energies beyond the 14 TeV limit of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using recently predicted and measured high-energy and ultra-high-energy neutrino fluxes from IceCube and KM3NeT, we estimate mass-scale sensitivities for representative new physics scenarios at 1--30 km$^3$ L$ν$Cs. Our results demonstrate that L$ν$Cs provide a novel avenue to probe multi-TeV particles with sensitivities comparable to, or even surpassing, those of the LHC.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13948v1,human
Probing Quadratically Coupled Ultralight Dark Matter with Pulsar Timing Arrays,"Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles. Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13945v1,human
Studying hard probe dynamics in QGP using effective field theory,"An effective field theory framework is developed to study the interaction of heavy quarks in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The latter is treated as a relativistic non-dissipative colorless fluid which can be studied using a derivatively coupled effective field theory based on previous work.

"Analysis of the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs","In this work, we analyze the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The coupling between interpolating currents and low spin particles is considered in the phenomenological side, and the vacuum condensates $\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^2GG \right\rangle ,\left\langle \bar qg_sσGq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^3GGG \right\rangle ,{\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ^2}$ are included in the QCD side. As an application of strong coupling constants, we also obtain the partial decay widths of these states, where $Γ_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_sπ}=10.3_{-2.9}^{+3.0}\mathrm{KeV}$,   $Γ_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*π}=24.8_{-5.4}^{+5.5}\mathrm{KeV}$, $Γ_{T_{BK}\rightarrow BK}=101_{-21}^{+36}\mathrm{MeV}$ and $Γ_{T_{B^*K}\rightarrow B^*K}=142_{-25}^{+52}\mathrm{MeV}$.

Perturbations to $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry due to renormalization group running effects,"$μ-τ$ reflection symmetry is an attractive flavour symmetry in lepton mixing, which accommodates maximal values of atmospheric mixing angle ($θ_{23}=π/4$) and Dirac CP phase ($δ=π/2/3π/2$). Another significance of this symmetry is that it does not constrain $θ_{13}$ to be zero. As the recent results from $T2K$ and $NOνA$ experiments indicate a near-maximal value of the Dirac CP phase, the role of $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry becomes more prominent. In this work, we study RG running effects as a perturbation to the $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry. Assuming the symmetry to be preserved at the seesaw scale, we study the deviations of mass eigenvalues and lepton mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to RG running. We derive the one-loop RGEs of the mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters and solve them numerically. Numerical analysis shows that the deviations from $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry are consistent with $3σ$ range of global oscillation data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13585v1,human
Hyperons and $Δ$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties,"The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $Δ$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} < R_e < 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574v1,human
Strange Pentaquark Molecules in QCD Sum Rules,"In this article, we systematically construct hidden- and open-strange pentaquarks in the hadronic molecular picture to search for possible partners of hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector using QCD sum rules. Within this picture, 21 distinct currents are constructed with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. There is no bound state found from $J^P = 1/2^-$ currents, while three of them from $J^P = 3/2^-$ currents are bound-state solutions consistent with the $Λ(2050)3/2^-$, $Ξ(2250)$, and $N(2120)3/2^-$ states, which can be identified as $Λφ$, $Ξφ$, and $ΣK^\ast$ hadronic molecular states, respectively. Other constructions are interpreted as hadronic molecular states composed of excited states with the same quantum numbers, and some of these exhibit mass values that align with known resonances listed in the RPP(PDG). Our numerical results indicate that $Λ(2050)3/2^-$ and $Ξ(2250)$ should be the multiplet partner of each other. Additionally, although $ΣK^\ast$ bound state was identified under this framework, no corresponding partner states were found within the context of the currents we constructed. Alternative constructions may offer new possibilities for identifying such states.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13548v3,human
The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe,"Following its launch on January 9, 2024, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533v1,human
Absence of Majorana-Weyl fermions in d=4 and the theory of Majorana fermions,"It is customary to identify $ψ_{+}=ν_{R} + C\overline{ν_{R}}^{T}$ with a Majorana fermion on the basis of chirality changing charge conjugation $\tilde{C}: ν_{R}\rightarrow C\overline{ν_{R}}^{T}$ and parity $\tilde{P}: ν_{R}\rightarrow iγ^{0}ν_{R}$. The theorem on the absence of a Majorana-Weyl fermion in $d=4$ states $\tilde{C}γ_{5}\tilde{C}^{-1}= -γ_{5}$ with $\tilde{C}=Cγ_{4}^{T}$, and thus the charge conjugation of the equivalent Majorana $ψ_{+}=(\frac{1+γ_{5}}{2})ν_{R} + (\frac{1-γ_{5}}{2})C\overline{ν_{R}}^{T}$ vanishes without auxiliary $γ_{5}\rightarrow - γ_{5}$.   To be consistent with the theorem, it is common to use a doublet representation of chirality preserving charge conjugation $\hat{C}:ν_{R,L}\rightarrow C\overline{ν_{L,R}}^{T}$ and parity $\hat{P}: ν_{R,L}\rightarrow iγ^{0}ν_{L,R}$ in theory containing both $ν_{R,L}$. In the type I seesaw model, the latter formulation is applicable but $ψ_{+}=ν_{R} + C\overline{ν_{R}}^{T}$ is not a Majorana fermion. An analogue of the Bogoliubov transformation converts $ψ_{\pm}=ν_{R, L} \pm C\overline{ν_{R, L}}^{T}$, which are obtained by a precise diagonalization of the seesaw model, to Majorana fermions $ψ_{M_{1,2}}=(ψ\pm C\overlineψ^{T})/\sqrt{2}$ with a Dirac-type fermion $ψ$, as originally defined by Majorana. A chiral projection $[(1+γ_{5})/2] ψ_{M_{1}}$ of a Majorana fermion is not a chiral fermion.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14998v2,human
Coscattering Dark Matter in Scotogenic Models,"The Scotogenic mechanism is an appealing pathway to naturally explain the common origin of dark matter and tiny neutrino mass. However, the conventional scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are required. For example, two real scalar singlets $φ_1$ and $φ_2$ are involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly degenerate $m_{φ_1}\lesssim m_{φ_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for the generation of dark matter $φ_1$, such as the coscattering process $φ_1\text{SM}\to φ_2 \text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $φ_1 φ_2 \to \text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel. We then comprehensively study the constraints of dark matter from Higgs decay, direct detection, and indirect detection. For the heavier dark scalar, the three-body decay $φ_2\toφ_1 f\bar{f}$ not only alerts the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background, but also leads to the observable displaced vertex signature at colliders.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13231v1,human
A short review on QCD sum rule studies of P-wave single heavy baryons,"Over the past few decades, the study of singly heavy baryons has entered a golden era, with numerous excited states observed by experimental collaborations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed to investigate their properties, with the QCD sum rule method being one of the most widely applied. This paper provides a review of these QCD sum rule studies. Over the last ten years, we have systematically studied $P$-wave singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. These $P$-wave singly heavy baryons can explain many excited heavy baryons, including the $Λ_c(2595)^+$, $Λ_c(2625)^+$, $Ξ_c(2790)^{0/+}$, $Ξ_c(2815)^{0/+}$, $Σ_c(2800)^0$, $Ξ_c(2882)^0$, $Ξ_c(2923)^0$, $Ξ_c(2939)^0$, $Ξ_c(2965)^0$, $Ω_c(3000)^0$, $Ω_c(3066)^0$, $Ω_c(3090)^0$, $Ω_c(3050)^0$, $Ω_c(3119)^0$, $Λ_b(5912)^0$, $Λ_b(5920)^0$, $Ξ_b(6087)^0$, $Ξ_b(6095)^0/Ξ_b(6100)^-$, $Σ_b(6097)^\pm$, $Ξ_b(6227)^-$, $Ω_b(6316)^-$, $Ω_b(6330)^-$, $Ω_b(6340)^-$, and $Ω_b(6350)^-$, etc. Furthermore, we predict additional $P$-wave singly heavy baryons, including two $Λ_b$ states, two $Ξ_b$ states, three $Σ_b$ states, three $Ξ_b^\prime$ states, two $Ω_b$ states, two $Λ_c$ states, two $Ξ_c$ states, three $Σ_c$ states, and one $Ω_c$ state, all with relatively narrow decay widths, making them viable candidates for experimental observation. The study of singly heavy baryons is closely related to two meaningful questions:""What is the shortest possible lifetime of an observable particle?"" and ""How can one generally describe approximate (flavor) symmetries?"".",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13013v1,human
Updated Constraints on Large Extra Dimensions from Reactor Antineutrino Experiments,"We investigate constraints on large extra dimensions (LED) using the latest results from reactor antineutrino experiments. Specifically, we analyze the full data sets from Daya Bay, RENO, KamLAND, NEOS, and STEREO to derive updated bounds. For the case of one extra dimension, we find constrains on its radius $a$ of $a \lesssim 0.58~{\rm μm}$ ($a \lesssim 0.12~{\rm μm}$) at the $99\%$ confidence level for normal (inverted) ordering, an improvement of approximately $\sim 20\%$ ($\sim 25\%$) with respect to previous bounds, assuming a massless lightest active neutrino. Furthermore, we present new limits on $4+d$ LED scenarios, with $d = 2, 3, 4$ denoting the number of extra dimensions, based on the same reactor data and assuming equal radii for all extra dimensions. We find that the constraints become increasingly stringent with a larger number of extra dimensions. In particular, $d = 4$ with a massless lightest active neutrino, we obtain limits of $a \lesssim 0.28~{\rm μm}$ for normal and $a \lesssim 0.05~{\rm μm}$ for inverted orderings at the $99\%$ confidence level.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12900v1,human
Hadronic vacuum polarization to three loops in chiral perturbation theory,"Hadronic vacuum polarization at low virtualities limits the precision of experimental tests of the standard model via important physical observables. Here we compute that effect in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to three loops. Among the master integrals that describe the amplitude, six are elliptic functions of the momentum. Of these five are new to this work, although all can be related to the three-loop sunset integral. The renormalizability of the amplitude hinges on relations between the master integrals that were not previously known and that are not consequences of the integration-by-parts reduction. Our result is intended to serve as a starting point for phenomenological calculations, as well as the computation of finite-volume corrections in lattice QCD.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12885v1,human
On the maximum compactness of neutron stars,"The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870v1,human
GEFF: The Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - A tool for inflationary gauge-field production,"The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12644v1,human

Initial-state geometry and multiplicity distributions in pp and pPb collisions,"This work investigates the possibility of accessing the initial geometric shape of the proton in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC, in particular the configuration in which the proton is made of three quarks linked by a Y-shape gluon string, called baryon junction. This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/ψ$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pp and pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12561v2,human
Constraining neutrino electromagnetic properties with recent low-energy electron recoil data at dark matter direct detection experiments,"Neutrinos that are elastically scattered off atomic electrons provide a unique opportunity to investigate the Standard Model (SM) and beyond SM physics. In this work, we explore the new physics effects of neutrino electromagnetic properties through elastic neutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments. The properties of interest include the neutrino magnetic moment, millicharge, and charge radius, all of which are natural consequences of non-zero neutrino masses. We investigate their effects by incorporating each property into the Standard Model (SM) framework, given the measured the solar neutrino flux. By analyzing the latest Run 0 and Run 1 datasets from the PandaX-4T experiment, together with recent results from XENONnT, we derive new constraints on each electromagnetic property of neutrino. We present both flavor-independent results, obtained using a common parameter for all three neutrino flavors, and flavor-dependent results, derived by marginalizing over the three neutrino flavor components. Bounds we obtained are comparable or improved compared to those reported in the previous studies.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12449v1,human
Search for the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ Molecular State $X_{2}(4013)$ in $K^{-}p$ and $pp$ Collisions,"Motivated by the interpretation of $X(3872)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, heavy-quark spin symmetry predicts a spin-2 partner, $X_{2}(4013)$, which can be regarded as a $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ molecule with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. Its experimental confirmation, however, remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the production mechanisms of $X_{2}(4013)$ in the reactions $K^{-}p \to Λ_{c}^{+} D_{s}^{-} X_{2}(4013)$ and $pp \to Λ_{c}^{+}Λ_{c}^{+} X_{2}(4013)$ within an effective Lagrangian framework. The production processes are modeled via $t$-channel $D/\bar{D}^{*}$ meson exchanges, while initial-state interactions (ISI) mediated by Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are also taken into account. Our calculations indicate that the total cross sections can reach the pb level, suggesting that $X_{2}(4013)$ may be accessible at current and future experiments such as AMBER@CERN and LHCb. Inclusion of ISI enhances the cross sections by nearly one order of magnitude. The differential distributions show distinct angular behaviors for the two reactions: the $K^{-}p$ reaction exhibits a forward-peaked distribution, whereas the $pp$ reaction shows a dip near central angles. This study provides a quantitative theoretical benchmark for future experimental searches of $X_2(4013)$ and highlights the importance of initial-state interactions (ISI) in high-energy particle investigations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12292v2,human
Constraining Heavy Neutral Leptons Coupled to the Tau-Neutrino Flavor at the Large Hadron Collider,"Displaced vertex (DV) signatures at colliders offer a powerful probe of new long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model. Among the best-motivated candidates are heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) - heavier counterparts of Standard Model neutrinos - which can account for the origin of neutrino masses and potentially produce di-leptonic DV signatures.   In this study, we demonstrate how existing DV searches at the LHC can be extended to probe HNLs that couple predominantly to the tau-neutrino flavor. While current search strategies rely on identifying a prompt lepton alongside a displaced vertex, we show that analyzing events without a prompt lepton enables sensitivity to the process $pp \to W \to τN$, where the tau decays hadronically and the HNL subsequently decays to a lepton pair and a neutrino.   We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of this process with HNLs decaying to $μ^+μ^-$ or $e^+e^-$ final states, apply ATLAS-inspired selection criteria, and optimize signal sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate cuts in the plane of di-lepton invariant mass and DV radial position significantly enhance signal visibility. We propose several such optimized strategies and show that even with Run 2 data $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ , existing bounds can be improved by more than an order of magnitude. Future high-luminosity runs may strengthen sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to current limits.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12248v1,human
A Solution to the Hierarchy Problem with Non-Linear Quantum Mechanics,"We argue that the hierarchy problem of the standard model of particle physics can be solved by adding a state-dependent term to the Higgs sector. We present an example of a scalar field with a Higgs-like potential with an additional term proportional to the expectation value of the squared Higgs field operator. We show that the mass can be parametrically lighter than the theory's energy-momentum cutoff without fine tuning. We find the Higgs mass can be technically natural, even with a Planck-scale cutoff. The simplest version of the theory may not be distinguishable from the standard model at colliders, but other versions might. In addition, some aspects of cosmological evolution can be different in this model, in some cases radically.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12030v1,human
Universality of the chiral soliton lattice in the low energy limit of QCD,"In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11946v1,human
Jet quenching without energy loss,"The onset of jet quenching, i.e. the suppression of high transverse momentum particles and jets, is an important question in the context of understanding the onset of collective behaviour and small collision systems. We investigate a minimal scenario where a hard parton experiences a single soft re-scattering that leaves the kinematics unmodified, but the colour exchange leads to a loss of colour coherence that is observable in the final distribution of fragments. In particular, the formation time of the first splitting as reconstructed at hadron level from jets using the formation time clustering algorithm is sensitive the loss of colour coherence. Moreover, it can distinguish the coherence loss scenario from a corresponding energy loss scenario, since small energy loss effects leave the formation time distribution unchanged.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11914v1,human
Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials,"Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields"" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913v1,human
New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions,"Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879v1,human
Modeling the TMD shape function in $J/ψ$ electroproduction,"The next-to-leading order hard function for quarkonium electroproduction is calculated within the framework of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization in the low-transverse-momentum regime. The structure of the TMD shape function in quarkonium leptoproduction is analyzed through its operator-level definition. Particular attention is given to the convolution of the unpolarized TMD gluon distribution with the TMD shape function, thereby illustrating the latter's phenomenological role. Building on this framework, we provide predictions for the unpolarized differential cross-section of $J/ψ$ electroproduction at the future Electron-Ion Collider in the region of small transverse momentum.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11809v2,human

Sequestered Conformal Anomaly Mediation (SCAM),"Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the naıve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11784v2,human
More Effective RS Field Theory,"In this paper we derive the effective theory for a stabilized five-dimensional warped geometry, addressing several outstanding issues in this derivation. These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11771v2,human
Revisiting the limits on dark matter annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime in light of electron and positron fluxes,"We revisit the upper bound on the annihilation cross-section, $\langleσv\rangle$ of a stable dark matter (DM) of mass $5\times10^2-10^{14}$ GeV by considering five different channels: $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $μ^+μ^-$, $τ^+τ^-$, and $e^+e^-$. We use the observed electron and positron fluxes from CALET, DAMPE, HESS, positron flux from AMS-02, and gamma-ray flux from HAWC, GRAPES-3, CASA-MIA to constrain the annihilation cross-section. We also consider unstable DM of mass $10^3-10^{16}$~GeV decaying to $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $μ^+μ^-$, $τ^+τ^-$, and $e^+e^-$ and derive the corresponding lower bound on the DM lifetime, $τ_{\rm DM}$. We find that the latest data from CALET gives a stringent constraint on $\langleσv\rangle$ in the low DM mass regime. For a typical DM mass of 1 TeV, we show that $\langleσv\rangle_{{\rm DM~DM}\rightarrowμ^+μ^-}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})~\rm cm^3/s$ is disfavored. On the other hand in the low mass regime, the AMS-02 gives a much stringent limit on the DM lifetime, excluding $τ_{\rm DM\rightarrowμ^+μ^-}\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{27})$ s for a 1 TeV mass of DM. In the high mass regime, typically $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ GeV, HAWC and CASA-MIA give the strongest constraints on $\langleσv\rangle$ and $τ_{\rm DM}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11700v1,human
Applying Normalizing Flows for spin correlations reconstruction in associated top-quark pair and dark matter production,"We apply a unified machine-learning framework based on Normalizing Flows (NFs) for the event-by-event reconstruction of invisible momenta and the subsequent evaluation of spin-sensitive observables in top-quark pair and dark-matter (DM) associated production processes. Building on recent studies in single-top + DM topologies, we extend the research to $t\bar{t}$ + DM final states. Inputs to our networks combine low-level four-momenta and missing transverse energy with high-level kinematic and angular variables. We compare a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor, an autoregressive flow, and the conditional $ν$-Flows model -- trained to learn the full conditional density. In these final states all the models perform well and demonstrate high reconstruction quality in independent regions split by $m_{t\bar{t}}$ for validation purposes.

Productions of $T_{cc}$ and its SU(3)-flavor symmetry and heavy quark spin symmetry partners in $B_c$ decays,"Inspired by the observation of the doubly charmed tetraquark state $T_{cc}$ at $pp$ collisions in the inclusive processes, we systematically investigate the production of doubly charmed tetraquark states in exclusive $B_c$ decays. In this work, we assume the $T_{cc}$ as a $DD^*$ bound state, and then predict the masses of its heavy quark spin symmetry partner $D^*D^*$ (denoted by $T_{cc}^{*}$) as well as their SU(3)-flavor symmetry partners, i.g., $D_sD^*/D_s^*D$ (denoted by $T_{ccs}^{+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{++}$) and $D^*D_s^*$ (denoted by $T_{ccs}^{*+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{*++}$), using the contact range effective field theory. Within the molecular picture, we compute their partial decays and production rates in $B_c$ meson decays. We identify the decays $B_c \to D^0D^0π^+\bar{D}^0 $ and $B_c \to D_s^+ D^{0} π^+{D}^{-}$ as promising channels to observe the tetraquark states $T_{cc}^{(*)}$ and $T_{ccs}^{(*)++}$, respectively. Finally, by combining these results with $B_c$ production cross sections, we estimate the expected event yields for these states in the upcoming LHC Run 3 and 4. Our results indicate that the $T_{ccs}^{+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{*++}$ states are likely to be observed in $B_c$ decays, while it is quite difficult for the $T_{cc}$ and $T_{cc}^{*}$ states.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11078v1,human
Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes,"Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux.

However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime. We derive the spin's response to gravitational waves and identify three distinct effects: the well-known Gertsenshtein effect, a metric-induced interaction, and the gravitational spin Hall effect. We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11009v1,human
"Three Birds with One Stone: Core-Collapsed SIDM Halos as the Common Origin of Dense Perturbers in Lenses, Streams, and Satellites","We show that core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^6\,{M_\odot}$, originally simulated to explain the dense perturber of the GD-1 stellar stream, also reproduce the structural properties inferred for the dense perturber detected in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666 from radio observations. Furthermore, these halos are sufficiently compact and dense to gravitationally capture field stars in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing a natural explanation for the origin of Fornax 6, a stellar cluster in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our results demonstrate that observations of halos with similar masses but residing in different cosmic environments offer a powerful and complementary probe of self-interacting dark matter.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11006v1,human
Topological Landscapes of the BSM Higgs Sector,"We explore the structure of the parameter space in the Singlet Scalar Dark Matter (SSDM) model and the Next-to-Two Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM) with $\tanβ= 5$ and $\tanβ= 45$. Parameter points are classified as allowed or excluded based on compatibility with the Higgs observation constraints. Using a combined framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we characterize the global geometry and topology of these high-dimensional landscapes. Our findings reveal that the SSDM and the N2HDM Type~I model exhibit finely tuned islands of collider viability. In the case of N2HDM Type~I, we also find that increasing $\tanβ$ leads to greater topological fragmentation and higher Betti number persistence, indicating enhanced structural complexity. In contrast, the given choice of parameters excludes the entire N2HDM Type II parameter space based on current Higgs measurements. The topological properties serve as important quantitative descriptors for the phenomenological viability of the BSM frameworks. We leverage the above mentioned topological features to train machine learning models for faster characterization of the BSM Higgs sector into allowed and excluded parameter regions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10900v1,human
Probing vorticity through femtoscopic correlations,"In heavy-ion collisions, as the two nuclei pass through one another and create hot and dense matter, part of their initial angular momentum is transferred to the fireball, generating a nonzero average vorticity. Understanding heavy-ion collision dynamics and its influence on key observables, including those used to probe the initial state or assess thermodynamics of nuclear matter, requires understanding the magnitude of effects tied to vorticity. In this work, we use simulations of non-central Au+Au collisions at $E_{\rm{kin}}=1.23~A\rm{GeV}$ to show that the rotation of the system impacts the space-time picture of particle emission and, in particular, leaves imprints on proton-pion femtoscopic correlations. Next, we use coarse-graining of the simulation outputs to extract the collective velocity as a function of position and time, shedding light on the dynamical origin of this effect. Moreover, we demonstrate that the displacement between the proton and pion emission centers quantifies the strength of the rotation and propose it as a new signal of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10795v1,human
First galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function limits on dark matter-proton scattering,"Scattering between dark matter (DM) and protons leads to suppressed small-scale fluctuations, with implications for a variety of cosmological observables. In this work, we search for evidence of DM-proton scattering with an interaction cross section $σ\!=\!σ_0 (\frac{v}{c})^n$ for $n=0,2$ and $4$, corresponding e.g. to velocity-independent contact interactions from heavy mediators, velocity-dependent pseudoscalar-mediated scattering, and higher-order dipole interactions, respectively, using high-redshift ($z \sim4-10$) ultraviolet galaxy luminosity functions (UVLFs) observed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We employ an adjusted implementation of GALLUMI combined with the modified Boltzmann solver CLASS DMeff that accounts for interacting DM, and incorporate UVLF data from both blank and lensed HST fields, alongside Planck CMB data and the Pantheon supernova catalog in a Bayesian analysis framework to set constraints on $σ_0$. Our results show that including lensed UVLF data, which probe fainter galaxies than the blank HST fields and thus smaller scales, leads to a substantial improvement in the constraints on $σ_0$ for $n>0$, surpassing existing bounds from Milky-Way (MW) satellite abundance and CMB anisotropies. For $m_χ = 1\,\rm MeV $, for example, we set the upper bounds at $8.3\times 10^{-26} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=2$ and $1.2\times 10^{-22} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=4$. For $n=0$, our bound is within an order of magnitude of those from the Lyman-$α$ forest and MW satellites.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10757v1,human
Two decades of algorithmic Feynman integral reduction,"We present a historiographical review of algorithms and computer codes developed for solving integration-by-parts relations for Feynman integrals.

In this review, we restrict ourselves to considering general algorithms which can, in principle, be applied to any family of Feynman integrals.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10748v2,human
Scattering of non-relativistic finite-size particles and puffy dark matter direct detection,"In this work we consider the scattering between non-relativistic particles with different finite sizes. We first calculate their interaction potential and apply the partial wave method to obtain their scattering cross section. Our findings show that the particle size can significantly affect the scattering between non-relativistic particles. Then we apply such a study to direct detection of puffy dark matter. We find that the finite size of the target nucleus may introduce non-perturbative effects that differ from the scenario of point-like dark matter. For large-size dark matter particles, this non-perturbative regime in the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section effectively disappears; while for small values of the size-to-range ratio in the scattering process, a significant non-perturbative regime can maintain. Finally, for the direct detection of nugget-type puffy dark matter with a small number of constituent particles, we find that the stability conditions for the formation of bound-state dark matter can provide constraints on the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10641v1,human
Quantum Integration Networks for Efficient Monte Carlo in High-Energy Physics,"Monte Carlo methods play a central role in particle physics, where they are indispensable for simulating scattering processes, modeling detector responses, and performing multi-dimensional integrals. However, traditional Monte Carlo methods often suffer from slow convergence and insufficient precision, particularly for functions with singular features such as rapidly varying regions or narrow peaks. Quantum circuits provide a promising alternative: compared to conventional neural networks, they can achieve rich expressivity with fewer parameters, and the parameter-shift rule provides an exact analytic form for circuit gradients, ensuring precise optimization. Motivated by these advantages, we investigate how sampling strategies and loss functions affect integration efficiency within the \textbf{Quantum Integration Network} (QuInt-Net). We compare adaptive and non-adaptive sampling approaches and examine the impact of different loss functions on accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, we explore three quantum circuit architectures for numerical integration: the data re-uploading model, the quantum signal processing protocol, and deterministic quantum computation with one qubit. The results provide new insights into optimizing QuInt-Nets for applications in high energy physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10501v1,human
Perturbative and non-perturbative properties of heavy quark transport in a thermal QCD medium,"We investigate the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of heavy quark transport in a thermal QCD medium. Based on the Soft-Hard Factorized Model (SHFM), we extend the original perturbative framework to the near-critical temperature region, where non-perturbative effects become significant. The transition behavior of the semi-Quark-Gluon-Plasma (semi-QGP) is described via a temperature-dependent background field incorporated in the background field effective theory. By implementing this approach, we quantitatively evaluate the collisional energy loss and momentum diffusion coefficients of charm and bottom quarks as functions of the incoming energy and medium temperature. Our results show a distinct suppression of both the energy loss and the diffusion coefficients relative to conventional perturbative estimates, especially near the critical temperature. This suppression originates from the emergence of a temperature-dependent color background field, which effectively reduces the color charge screening of the medium. These findings provide important theoretical insight into the phenomenology of heavy-flavor probes in QGP, offering a unified theoretical framework applicable across both high- and low-momentum regimes.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10294v1,human
Medium modifications of $1P$-wave charmonia $χ_{cJ}(1P)$ in cold nuclear matter,"In this work, we employ the quark-meson coupling model to investigate the mass shifts of $1P$-wave charmonia $χ_{cJ}(1P)$ ($J=0,1,2$) in cold symmetric nuclear matter by incorporating in-medium loop contributions to the $χ_{cJ}(1P)$ self-energy within the unquenched picture. At normal nuclear matter density, we obtain significant mass reductions of about 60 MeV for the $χ_{cJ}(1P)$ states, with the $χ_{c2}(1P)$ mass shift primarily arising from the vector-vector loop. Our results also indicate the absence of level crossing between the in-medium $χ_{cJ}(1P)$ mass and the $D\bar{D}$ mass threshold up to $ρ_B < 3ρ_0$-a feature that could be probed in the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at FAIR and the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC.",CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10200v1,human
Efficiency correction of particle-averaged quantities,We derive analytic formulas to reconstruct particle-averaged quantities from experimental results that suffer from the efficiency loss of particle measurements.

A LENS on DUNE-PRISM: Characterizing a Neutrino Beam with Off-Axis Measurements,"Upcoming precision long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments will be severely limited by the large systematic uncertainties associated with neutrino flux predictions and neutrino--nucleus cross sections. A promising remedy is the PRISM (Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement) technique, whereby the near detector measures the neutrino spectrum at different angles with respect to the beam axis. These measurements are then linearly combined into a prediction of the oscillated neutrino flux at the far detector. This prediction is data-driven, but still dependent on some theoretical knowledge about the neutrino flux. In this paper, we study to what extent off-axis measurements themselves can be used to directly constrain neutrino flux models. In particular, we use them to extract separately the fluxes and spectra of different meson species in the beam. We call this measurement LENS (Lateral Extraction of Neutrino Spectra). Second, we demonstrate how the thus improved flux model helps to further constrain the far detector flux prediction, thereby ultimately improving oscillation measurements.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09546v1,human
Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations,"We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational symmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables, parameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries may be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542v1,human
The two-mass contributions to the three-loop massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $Δ\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$,"We calculate the two-mass three-loop contributions to the unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $Δ\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ in $x$-space for a general mass ratio by using a semi-analytic approach. We also compute Mellin moments up to $N = 2000 (3000)$ by an independent method, to which we compare the results in $x$-space. In the polarized case, we work in the Larin scheme. We present numerical results. The two-mass contributions amount to about $50 \%$ of the full \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^2)$} and \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^3)$} terms contributing to the operator matrix elements. The present result completes the calculation of all unpolarized and polarized massive three-loop operator matrix elements.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09403v1,human
Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes,"We point out that a simple redefinition of the regularizing parameter in regular black hole (RBH) metrics can preserve the self-similarity of the evaporation process. This implies that a RBH can evaporate completely, mirroring the behavior of its singular counterpart. Consequently, RBHs need not evolve into exotic, unverified remnant states such as horizonless compact objects or wormholes. We then provide a generic framework to study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). As illustrative examples, we explicitly work out the cases of the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric. The formalism can be readily applied to other metrics. RPBH generally exhibits different Hawking temperature and horizon size compared to their singular counterpart, leading to distinct lifetime and mass evolution. We calculate the resulting modified cosmological constraints and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance. This intriguing scenario provides a unified resolution to both the DM problem and the black hole singularity problem, while preserving the standard self-similar evaporation process.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09395v2,human

When inverse seesaw meets inverse electroweak phase transition: a novel path to leptogenesis,"We propose a new nonthermal leptogenesis mechanism triggered by the cosmic first-order phase transition. The Standard Model is extended with two generations of TeV-scale vectorlike leptons. The lighter generation gives rise to an inverse electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field at $T\sim200~{\rm GeV}$, restoring the symmetry, and resulting in relativistic bubble expansion in the space. The heavier generation is responsible for neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The interaction between bubble walls and particles in the plasma abundantly produces the vectorlike leptons, and they subsequently undergo CP-violating decay to generate the baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is testable at current and future particle experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09000v1,human
Semihard interactions at TeV energies,"We investigate the high-energy behavior of the total cross section, $σ_{\text{tot}}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $ρ$, in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton channels. Our analysis is based on a QCD-inspired model in which the rise of the cross sections is predominantly driven by semihard processes involving gluons. We address the tension between measurements from the ATLAS/ALFA and TOTEM Collaborations, showing that independent analyses of their datasets can provide statistically consistent descriptions of the overall data, even though they do not fully reproduce the central values of the $ρ$ parameter at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The slight discrepancy between these central values and the model's predicted values, obtained using an asymptotic dominant crossing-even elastic scattering amplitude, points to the potential presence of an odd component in the semihard amplitude at high energies.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08963v1,human
Jet Energy-Energy Correlator in Cold QCD Matter,"We present a study of medium-induced modifications to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) for jets in cold nuclear matter. For electron-nucleus collisions, at leading order in the QCD coupling and in the jet-medium interaction, we derive an analytic expression for the EEC modification as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. The dependence on jet energy, the transport properties of cold nuclear matter, and the in-medium path length is made explicit. We further extend the analysis to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare with preliminary proton-lead data from the LHC. Possible effects of comovers on the EEC in proton-nucleus collisions are also discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08927v1,human
Open heavy-flavor transport and hadronization in heavy-ion collisions,"We develop a comprehensive model for heavy-quark evolution in a realistic QGP, from their production in the initial collision to hadronic freeze-out. Heavy-quark transport is described by a Langevin approach including medium-induced radiation, coupled to a 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic bulk evolution. Transport coefficients are obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix calculations with resonant correlations near the transition temperature. Hadronization is implemented via two fragmentation+recombination schemes: an improved sudden coalescence model and a resonance recombination model. We present results for key open heavy-flavor observables, i.e., the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow, and compare to LHC Pb-Pb data at $\sqrt{s_{\NN}}$=5.02\,TeV.}",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08923v1,human
Towards Quantum Simulations of Sphaleron Dynamics at Colliders,"Sphaleron dynamics in the Standard Model at high-energy particle collisions remains experimentally unobserved, with theoretical predictions hindered by its nonperturbative real-time nature. In this work, we investigate a quantum simulation approach to this challenge. Taking the $1+1$D $O(3)$ model as a protocol towards studying dynamics of sphaleron in the electroweak theory, we identify the sphaleron configuration and establish lattice parameters that reproduce continuum sphaleron energies with controlled precision. We then develop quantum algorithms to simulate sphaleron evolutions where quantum effects can be included. This work lays the ground to establish quantum simulations for studying the interaction between classical topological objects and particles in the quantum field theory that are usually inaccessible to classical methods and computations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08910v1,human
Taming forward scattering singularities in partial waves,"Perturbative partial-wave amplitudes diverge in cases with a massless exchanged particle in the $t$-channel. We argue that the divergence is an artifact of perturbation theory and give a prescription for the all-orders correction factor that renders the partial waves finite. As an example, we apply this to longitudinal $W^+W^-$ elastic scattering, for which there is a photon exchange $t$-channel contribution, and derive improved quasi-perturbative unitarity bounds on the mass of the Higgs. The method is also useful for $t$-channel exchange of very light particles.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08784v1,human
Loop functions of sunset diagrams in 2+1 space-time dimensions,"In these notes the relativistic $n$-body phase-phase is calculated iteratively in $2+1$ space-time dimensions for all $n$. The obtained result shows a simple power-law behavior $α_n (μ-M)^{n-2}/μ$ with a dependence only on the total mass $M=m_1+\dots + m_n$. As a consequence of this feature, the $(n-1)$-loop integrals $J_n(-q^2)$ associated to sunset diagrams with $n$ internal lines can be expressed through of elementary (arctangent and logarithmic) functions, modulo polynomial terms in $q^2$ with regularization-dependent coefficients. An outlook to the analogous situation in $4+1$ space-time dimensions is given by computing the $n$-body phase-phases for $n=2,3,4,5$ with their totally symmetric dependence on the involved masses. Moreover, a digression to $1+1$ space-time dimensions reveals that there the three-body phase-space is already proportional to a complete elliptic integral.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08704v2,human
Hydrodynamic models of Reheating,"We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685v1,human
Expanding the Landscape of Exotic Muon Decays,"We chart new-physics models that produce exotic, high-multiplicity muon decays featuring prompt or displaced $e^+e^-$ pairs and/or photons, with or without missing energy, such as $μ\to 5e$, $μ\to 7e$, etc. Starting from an effective-field-theory perspective, we estimate the reach on the ultraviolet scale and identify conditions under which lower-multiplicity modes are suppressed or occur at comparable rates. We then construct explicit realizations in minimal dark-sector models with light, feebly interacting particles, such as flavor-protected scalars, dark photons, inelastic dark matter, and axion-like particles. The predicted novel signatures can be probed at MEG II and Mu3e, as well as during calibration runs of COMET and Mu2e.

Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals,"The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514v1,human
Constraining the new contributions to electron $g-2$ in a radiative neutrino mass model,"We examine electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments within a radiative neutrino mass model featuring TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks $S(3,1,-1/3)$ and $R(3,2,1/6)$. We utilize textures with decoupling electron and muon sectors, so that both electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments could receive internal chiral enhancements from different heavy up-type quarks while in the same time evading the stringent $μ\to eγ$ constraint. A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions. This severely constrains the parameter space of the model, which results in a negligible new physics correction to the muon $g-2$. The electron $g-2$ discrepancy implied by the rubidium experiment, on the other hand, can be resolved within $2σ$ uncertainty provided that neutrino mass ordering is inverted. Lepton-flavor-violating tau decay rates, such as $τ\to eγ$ and $τ\to 3e$, are predicted to be within the sensitivities of next-generation experiments.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08504v2,human
"Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits","Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375v1,human
Revisiting the soft-hard separation in the transverse momentum spectra of $pp$ collisions,"We study the separation of soft and hard components in the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles as measured by ALICE in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 2.76 TeV, 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV at the LHC. The soft component is described by a Boltzmann fit, while the residual spectra are identified as hard QCD-like fragmentation. After separation, the subtracted spectra show no evolution in the shape or peak position with multiplicity, supporting a two-component interpretation. Mean transverse momenta for both contributions remain nearly constant, while Pythia 8 Monte Carlo simulations confirm these trends. Our results support the two-component description as a robust alternative to hydrodynamical interpretations.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09692v1,human
Neutrinoless double beta decay in a supersymmetric left-right model,"Neutrinoless double beta ($0νββ$) decay, an important low-energy process, serves not only as a potential test of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, but also as a sensitive probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this study, the supersymmetric left-right model is explored to investigate its impact on $0νββ$ decay. Although the process takes place at low energies as compared to the electroweak scale, it carries the potential to provide indirect hints about the parity-breaking scale $\text{M}_R$. In this work, we formulate the decay amplitude using an effective field theory approach by separating long- and short-range contributions, each expressed in terms of dimensionless particle physics parameters and nuclear matrix elements. The analysis shows that the $\text{M}_R$ must lie above $1$ TeV, and future experiments may push it beyond $4 - 5$ TeV region. Another important outcome of this work is the role played by the tentative dark matter candidates, the lightest neutralino and sneutrino, which contribute significantly to the half-life of $0νββ$ decay. This suggests that if any supersymmetric particle is detected in future experiments, dark matter candidates will gain a permanent position in these extensions of the Standard Model.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08090v1,human
Atomic Observables Induced by Cosmic Fields,"The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic potentials.

The numerical results show agreement with masses of $f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(1370)$, $f_{0}(1500)$, $f_{0}(2020)$, $f_{0}(2200)$, $h_{1}(1170)$, $h_{1}(1595)$, $h_{1}(1900)$, $h_{1}(1965)$, $h_{1}(2215)$, $f_{2}(1430)$, $f_{2}(1640)$, $f_{2}(1810)$, $f_{2}(2010)$, $f_{2}(2150)$, $a_{0}(980)$, $a_{0}(1450)$, $a_{0}(1950)$, $a_{1}(1260)$, $a_{1}(1640)$, $a_{2}(1700)$, $K^{*}_{0}(1430)$, $K^{*}_{0}(1950)$, $K_{1}(1270)$, $K_{1}(1440)$, $K_{1}(1650)$, and $K^{*}_{2}(1980)$. The results shed light on the spectrum of these mesons and offer guidande to search for the tetraquarks in the future.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07836v1,human
Probing the Neutron Skin with Extreme Collision Geometries in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Understanding how protons and neutrons are located differently in an atomic nucleus can provide fundamental information on nuclear structure and have far-reaching implications for astrophysics. A precise determination of this important difference, often quantified by the so-called neutron skin thickness, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show how one can use a new category of observables in heavy ion collisions to probe the neutron skin thickness of nuclei like $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, by utilizing the asymmetry between neutrons and protons of spectator nucleons in super-central collisions as well as that of participant nucleons in peripheral collisions. Using quantitative simulations, we demonstrate their sensitivity and great potential in constraining neutron skin thickness for both $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca nuclei in these extreme event geometries. Furthermore, we propose the asymmetric collisions between $^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca nuclei as a unique and powerful way to nail down the neutron skin thickness.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07816v1,human
Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability,"We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability, leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07467v1,human
Simulation-based inference for neutrino interaction model parameter tuning,"High-energy physics experiments studying neutrinos rely heavily on simulations of their interactions with atomic nuclei. Limitations in the theoretical understanding of these interactions typically necessitate ad hoc tuning of simulation model parameters to data. Traditional tuning methods for neutrino experiments have largely relied on simple algorithms for numerical optimization. While adequate for the modest goals of initial efforts, the complexity of future neutrino tuning campaigns is expected to increase substantially, and new approaches will be needed to make progress. In this paper, we examine the application of simulation-based inference (SBI) to the neutrino interaction model tuning for the first time. Using a previous tuning study performed by the MicroBooNE experiment as a test case, we find that our SBI algorithm can correctly infer the tuned parameter values when confronted with a mock data set generated according to the MicroBooNE procedure. This initial proof-of-principle illustrates a promising new technique for next-generation simulation tuning campaigns for the neutrino experimental community.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07454v1,human
Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw,"In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter in a low-scale seesaw setup. The Type-I seesaw framework is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($Φ_ν$), which couples exclusively with the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby forming the neutrino Dirac mass term, while the first doublet is responsible for the mass generation of the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) serves as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced primarily through W and Z boson decays -a previously overlooked dominant contribution that solely determines the relic abundance. Owing to the small vev ($v_ν\sim 10$ MeV) of the second Higgs doublet, an enhancement in the available parameter space of the sterile neutrino masses is observed, spanning from sub-keV to $0.2$ GeV. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$α$ forest observations it is found that the setup is able to accommodate both warm and cold dark matter options.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433v1,human
Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way,"Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$ν$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$ν$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$ν$F. Moreover, most of the GS$ν$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$ν$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$ν$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$ν$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399v1,human
Slepton pair production at next-to-leading power,"Near threshold, cross sections for the production of heavy particles are sensitive to large logarithmic terms, which must be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory. Current state-of-the art calculations for inclusive slepton pair production at hadron colliders has focused on higher-order logarithms in the leading power of the threshold variable. Here, we evaluate the next-to-leading power contribution in the threshold variable to leading logarithmic accuracy. We find that the next-to-leading power contributions can be significant compared to the next-to-leading logarithmic terms at leading power, and that existing calculations underestimate the scale error for large slepton masses. We include results for a potential future FCC-hh machine at $\sqrt{s}=85$ TeV.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07397v1,human
Probing Dark Matter Interactions with Stellar Motion near Sagittarius A*,"Stars orbiting Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center provide a unique laboratory to test gravity and dark matter (DM). We demonstrate that DM interactions in stellar interiors induce a novel momentum transfer force, altering orbits beyond gravitational effects. Using S2's 2000-2019 orbital data we derive the first astrophysical constraints on DM-nucleon scattering, excluding new sub-GeV parameter space. Stellar lifetime constraints over Myr timescales complement these, surpassing some direct detection and cosmological limits. This establishes stellar dynamics as a novel probe of DM interactions.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07387v1,human
Axion Quality Problem: Keep Calm and Baryon,"Axion models generically suffer from a severe quality problem when coupled to gravity. In this article we provide a very simple model with a high quality axion. The axion is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the baryon number symmetry, $U(1)_B$, of a new composite sector that breaks $U(1)_B$ spontaneously when it confines. A controlled example is a supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with $N_c = N_f$. The axion shift symmetry is automatically protected due to the high dimension of the gauge-invariant baryon operator, with the Peccei-Quinn breaking operators arising at dimension $N_c+2$. The standard model gauge group is embedded as a subgroup of the flavor symmetry group of SQCD that has an anomaly with $U(1)_B$, generating the standard coupling with gluons.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07366v1,human
Correlation Function/Wilson Loop Duality in Gauge Theory from EFT,"In this Letter, we initiate a systematic study of the $n$-point correlation functions (CF) in gauge theories in the sequential light-cone (SLC) limit. Focusing on QCD, we formulate a factorization theorem for the CF of four vector currents in this limit using tools from soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET). This result unveils a duality between CF and Wilson loops in non-conformal field theories, according to which the singular structure of the CF is described by a null polygonal Wilson loop dressed by universal jet functions and current form factors, directly related to well-known ingredients in collider physics. We employ this new factorization theorem to obtain the singular terms of the four-point CF in QCD in the SLC limit up to three loops. This constitutes the first determination of terms beyond one loop and in particular determines, for the first time, conformal-symmetry-breaking terms induced by the non-vanishing $β$-function of QCD. As a stringent check, we verify that our result satisfies the anomalous conformal Ward identities and its leading-transcendental term reproduces the known correlation function in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM to three loops. Our results are easily generalized to the multi-point case, offering a powerful tool for future applications of SCET to the study of the fundamental structure of gauge theories.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07377v1,human

Texture-zeros in minimal seesaw from non-invertible symmetry fusion rules,"The $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry can enforce certain elements of the fermion Yukawa couplings to vanish. We have performed a systematical study of texture zero patterns of lepton mass matrices in the minimal seesaw model, and we present all the possible patterns of the charged lepton Yukawa coupling $Y_E$, neutrino Yukawa coupling $Y_ν$, right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M_R$ and the light neutrino mass matrix $M_ν$ which can be derived from the $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry. The realization of the textures with the maximum number of zeros and the second maximum number of zeros from non-invertible symmetry is studied, and the phenomenological implications in neutrino oscillation are discussed.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07236v1,human
FIRE 7: Automatic Reduction with Modular Approach,"FIRE7 is a major update to the FIRE program for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals. A large part of improvements is related to the automatic reduction and reconstruction with the modular arithmetic approach, while the performance of the classical rational polynomial approach is also significantly increased. An improved presolve algorithm performs Gaussian elimination to simplify IBP identities before substituting numerical indices as in the Laporta algorithm. Various new command line tools are included to facilitate tasks such as applying an IBP reduction table to reduce a loop integrand as a linear combination of individual integrals.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07150v1,human
Transport-based initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions at finite densities,"We employ the SMASH transport model to provide event-by-event initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and conserved charge currents in hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We study the fluctuations and dynamical evolution of three conserved charge currents (net baryon, net electric charges, and net strangeness) with a 4D lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, in the hydrodynamic phase. Out-of-equilibrium corrections at the particlization are generalized to finite densities to ensure the conservation of energy, momentum, and the three types of charges. These theoretical developments are integrated within X-SCAPE as a unified framework for studying the nuclear matter properties in the Beam Energy Scan program.",CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06996v1,human
