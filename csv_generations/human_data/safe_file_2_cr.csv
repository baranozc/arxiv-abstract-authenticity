TAB-DRW: A DFT-based Robust Watermark for Generative Tabular Data,"The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.",2025-11-26 17:16:14+00:00,2025-11-26 17:16:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21600v1
MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV,"Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.   The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.   We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.   We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.   MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.",2025-11-26 16:22:41+00:00,2025-11-26 16:22:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552v1
Constructing and Benchmarking: a Labeled Email Dataset for Text-Based Phishing and Spam Detection Framework,"Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.",2025-11-26 14:40:06+00:00,2025-11-26 14:40:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21448v1
Illuminating the Black Box: Real-Time Monitoring of Backdoor Unlearning in CNNs via Explainable AI,"Backdoor attacks pose severe security threats to deep neural networks by embedding malicious triggers that force misclassification. While machine unlearning techniques can remove backdoor behaviors, current methods lack transparency and real-time interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into the unlearning process to provide real-time monitoring and explainability. We propose the Trigger Attention Ratio (TAR) metric to quantitatively measure the model's attention shift from trigger patterns to legitimate object features. Our balanced unlearning strategy combines gradient ascent on backdoor samples, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for catastrophic forgetting prevention, and a recovery phase for clean accuracy restoration. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with BadNets attacks demonstrate that our approach reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 96.51% to 5.52% while retaining 99.48% of clean accuracy (82.06%), achieving a 94.28% ASR reduction. The integration of explainable AI enables transparent, observable, and verifiable backdoor removal.",2025-11-26 11:29:11+00:00,2025-11-26 11:29:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21291v1
Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack: Definition and Evaluation on Medical Image Data,"With the rapid expansion of data lakes storing health data and hosting AI algorithms, a prominent concern arises: how safe is it to export machine learning models from these data lakes? In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.   This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.   Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported.",2025-11-26 09:55:17+00:00,2025-11-26 09:55:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21227v1
CAHS-Attack: CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search Attack Method for Stable Diffusion,"Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.",2025-11-26 08:52:44+00:00,2025-11-26 08:52:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21180v1
GuardTrace-VL: Detecting Unsafe Multimodel Reasoning via Iterative Safety Supervision,"Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.",2025-11-26 02:49:51+00:00,2025-11-26 02:49:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20994v1
Dataset Poisoning Attacks on Behavioral Cloning Policies,"Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Readout-Side Bypass for Residual Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models,"Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.",2025-11-25 23:27:53+00:00,2025-11-25 23:27:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922v1
"Securing the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Risks, Controls, and Governance","The Model Context Protocol (MCP) replaces static, developer-controlled API integrations with more dynamic, user-driven agent systems, which also introduces new security risks. As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end. We close by outlining open research questions around verifiable registries, formal methods for these dynamic systems, and privacy-preserving agent operations.",2025-11-25 23:24:26+00:00,2025-11-25 23:24:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20920v1
"A Taxonomy of Pix Fraud in Brazil: Attack Methodologies, AI-Driven Amplification, and Defensive Strategies","This work presents a review of attack methodologies targeting Pix, the instant payment system launched by the Central Bank of Brazil in 2020. The study aims to identify and classify the main types of fraud affecting users and financial institutions, highlighting the evolution and increasing sophistication of these techniques. The methodology combines a structured literature review with exploratory interviews conducted with professionals from the banking sector. The results show that fraud schemes have evolved from purely social engineering approaches to hybrid strategies that integrate human manipulation with technical exploitation. The study concludes that security measures must advance at the same pace as the growing complexity of attack methodologies, with particular emphasis on adaptive defenses and continuous user awareness.",2025-11-25 22:41:57+00:00,2025-11-25 22:41:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20902v1
Private Data Imputation,"Data imputation is an important data preparation task where the data analyst replaces missing or erroneous values to increase the expected accuracy of downstream analyses. The accuracy improvement of data imputation extends to private data analyses across distributed databases. However, existing data imputation methods violate the privacy of the data rendering the privacy protection in the downstream analyses obsolete. We conclude that private data analysis requires private data imputation.   In this paper, we present the first optimized protocols for private data imputation. We consider the case of horizontally and vertically split data sets. Our optimization aims to reduce most of the computation to private set intersection (or at least oblivious programmable pseudo-random function) protocols which can be very efficiently computed. We show that private data imputation has -- on average across all evaluated datasets -- an accuracy advantage of 20\% in case of vertically split data and 5\% in case of horizontally split data over imputing data locally. In case of the worst data split we observed that imputing using our method resulted in an increase of up to 32.7 times in the quality of imputation over the vertically split data and 3.4 times in case of horizontally split data. Our protocols are very efficient and run in 2.4 seconds in case of vertically split data and 8.4 seconds in case of horizontally split data for 100,000 records evaluated in the 10 Gbps network setting, performing one data imputation.",2025-11-25 20:31:05+00:00,2025-11-25 20:31:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20832v1
Quantum-Resistant Authentication Scheme for RFID Systems Using Lattice-Based Cryptography,"We propose a novel quantum-resistant mutual authentication scheme for radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels.",2025-11-25 18:49:29+00:00,2025-11-25 18:49:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20630v1
"Quantum Key Distribution: Bridging Theoretical Security Proofs, Practical Attacks, and Error Correction for Quantum-Augmented Networks","Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.",2025-11-25 18:31:02+00:00,2025-11-25 18:31:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20602v1
"Engel p-adic Isogeny-based Cryptography over Laurent Series: Foundations, Security, and an ESP32 Implementation","Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) against quantum attacks requires public-key cryptography that (i) remains compact and (ii) runs efficiently on microcontrollers, capabilities many post-quantum (PQ) schemes lack due to large keys and heavy arithmetic. We address both constraints simultaneously with, to our knowledge, the first-ever isogeny framework that encodes super-singular elliptic-curve isogeny data via novel Engel expansions over the p-adic Laurent series. Engel coefficients compress torsion information, thereby addressing the compactness constraint, yielding public keys of ~1.1 - 16.9 kbits preserving the hallmark small sizes of isogeny systems. Engel arithmetic is local and admits fixed-precision p-adic operations, enabling micro-controller efficiency with low-memory, branch-regular kernels suitable for embedded targets.",2025-11-25 17:35:54+00:00,2025-11-25 17:35:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20533v1
A Reality Check on SBOM-based Vulnerability Management: An Empirical Study and A Path Forward,"The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical tool for securing the software supply chain (SSC), but its practical utility is undermined by inaccuracies in both its generation and its application in vulnerability scanning. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, establishing a reliable foundation for security analysis. Using this high-fidelity foundation, however, we expose a more fundamental flaw in practice: downstream vulnerability scanners produce a staggering 97.5\% false positive rate. We pinpoint the primary cause as the flagging of vulnerabilities within unreachable code. We then demonstrate that function call analysis can effectively prune 63.3\% of these false alarms. Our work validates a practical, two-stage approach for SSC security: first, generate an accurate SBOM using lock files and strong package managers, and second, enrich it with function call analysis to produce actionable, low-noise vulnerability reports that alleviate developers' alert fatigue.",2025-11-25 13:52:16+00:00,2025-11-25 13:52:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20313v1
Improving the Identification of Real-world Malware's DNS Covert Channels Using Locality Sensitive Hashing,"Nowadays, malware increasingly uses DNS-based covert channels in order to evade detection and maintain stealthy communication with its command-and-control servers. While prior work has focused on detecting such activity, identifying specific malware families and their behaviors from captured network traffic remains challenging due to the variability of DNS. In this paper, we present the first application of Locality Sensitive Hashing to the detection and identification of real-world malware utilizing DNS covert channels. Our approach encodes DNS subdomain sequences into statistical similarity features that effectively capture anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Combined with a Random Forest classifier, our method achieves higher accuracy and reduced false positive rates than prior approaches, while demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to previously unseen or modified malware samples. We further demonstrate that our approach enables reliable classification of malware behavior (e.g., uploading or downloading of files), based solely on DNS subdomains.",2025-11-25 12:00:58+00:00,2025-11-25 12:00:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20229v1
On the Feasibility of Hijacking MLLMs' Decision Chain via One Perturbation,"Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.   This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying ""non-motorized lane"" signs as ""motorized lane"" and ""pedestrian"" as ""plastic bag"".   To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.",2025-11-25 07:13:13+00:00,2025-11-25 07:13:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20002v1
Cross-LLM Generalization of Behavioral Backdoor Detection in AI Agent Supply Chains,"As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.",2025-11-25 03:33:04+00:00,2025-11-25 03:33:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19874v1
Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?,"In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.",2025-11-24 22:32:03+00:00,2025-11-24 22:32:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710v1
DUALGUAGE: Automated Joint Security-Functionality Benchmarking for Secure Code Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.",2025-11-24 22:26:14+00:00,2025-11-24 22:26:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20709v1
Prompt Fencing: A Cryptographic Approach to Establishing Security Boundaries in Large Language Model Prompts,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.",2025-11-24 21:44:33+00:00,2025-11-24 21:44:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19727v1
Accuracy and Efficiency Trade-Offs in LLM-Based Malware Detection and Explanation: A Comparative Study of Parameter Tuning vs. Full Fine-Tuning,"This study examines whether Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can approximate the performance of fully fine-tuned models in generating human-interpretable decisions and explanations for malware classification. Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.",2025-11-24 19:37:13+00:00,2025-11-24 19:37:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19654v1
Synthetic Data: AI's New Weapon Against Android Malware,"The ever-increasing number of Android devices and the accelerated evolution of malware, reaching over 35 million samples by 2024, highlight the critical importance of effective detection methods. Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.",2025-11-24 19:27:58+00:00,2025-11-24 19:27:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19649v1
Medusa: Cross-Modal Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

FedPoisonTTP: A Threat Model and Poisoning Attack for Federated Test-Time Personalization,"Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.",2025-11-24 16:02:01+00:00,2025-11-24 16:02:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19248v1
Adversarial Attack-Defense Co-Evolution for LLM Safety Alignment via Tree-Group Dual-Aware Search and Optimization,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.",2025-11-26 15:12:18+00:00,2025-11-24 15:23:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19218v2
LLM-CSEC: Empirical Evaluation of Security in C/C++ Code Generated by Large Language Models,"The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.",2025-11-24 10:31:53+00:00,2025-11-24 10:31:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18966v1
AttackPilot: Autonomous Inference Attacks Against ML Services With LLM-Based Agents,"Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.",2025-11-24 10:14:14+00:00,2025-11-24 10:14:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19536v1
Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Exploits with Responsible AI Considerations,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

RoguePrompt: Dual-Layer Ciphering for Self-Reconstruction to Circumvent LLM Moderation,"Content moderation pipelines for modern large language models combine static filters, dedicated moderation services, and alignment tuned base models, yet real world deployments still exhibit dangerous failure modes. This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone.",2025-11-24 05:42:54+00:00,2025-11-24 05:42:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18790v1
TASO: Jailbreak LLMs via Alternative Template and Suffix Optimization,"Many recent studies showed that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where an attacker can perturb the input of an LLM to induce it to generate an output for a harmful question. In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., ""Sure"").   In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses. Thus, they can be combined to improve the attack's effectiveness.   We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek). The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs. We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction.",2025-11-26 02:49:38+00:00,2025-11-23 18:49:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18581v2
"Zero-Trust Strategies for O-RAN Cellular Networks: Principles, Challenges and Research Directions","Cellular networks have become foundational to modern communication, supporting a broad range of applications, from civilian use to enterprise systems and military tactical networks. The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler. We analyze how ZTA principles align with the architectural and operational characteristics of O-RAN, and identify key challenges and opportunities for embedding zero-trust mechanisms within O-RAN-based cellular networks.",2025-11-23 18:25:19+00:00,2025-11-23 18:25:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18568v1
DEXO: A Secure and Fair Exchange Mechanism for Decentralized IoT Data Markets,"Opening up data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices for public utilization can maximize their economic value. Challenges remain in the trustworthiness of the data sources and the security of the trading process, particularly when there is no trust between the data providers and consumers. In this paper, we propose DEXO, a decentralized data exchange mechanism that facilitates secure and fair data exchange between data consumers and distributed IoT/mobile data providers at scale, allowing the consumer to verify the data generation process and the providers to be compensated for providing authentic data, with correctness guarantees from the exchange platform. To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion. We implemented a prototype of the DEXO system to demonstrate feasibility. The evaluation shows a moderate deployment cost and significantly improved blockchain operation efficiency compared to a popular data exchange mechanism.",2025-11-23 15:29:24+00:00,2025-11-23 15:29:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18498v1
Shadows in the Code: Exploring the Risks and Defenses of LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Development Systems,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.",2025-11-23 14:26:35+00:00,2025-11-23 14:26:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18467v1
Vision Token Masking Alone Cannot Prevent PHI Leakage in Medical Document OCR: A Systematic Evaluation,"Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.",2025-11-23 03:45:22+00:00,2025-11-23 03:45:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272v1
Carbon-Aware Intrusion Detection: A Comparative Study of Supervised and Unsupervised DRL for Sustainable IoT Edge Gateways,"The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified cybersecurity challenges, particularly in mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at the network edge. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) face significant limitations, including poor adaptability to evolving and zero-day attacks, reliance on static signatures and labeled datasets, and inefficiency on resource-constrained edge gateways. Moreover, most existing DRL-based IDS studies overlook sustainability factors such as energy efficiency and carbon impact. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS: DeepEdgeIDS, an unsupervised Autoencoder-DRL hybrid, and AutoDRL-IDS, a supervised LSTM-DRL model. Both DRL-based IDS are validated through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on edge gateways. Results demonstrate that AutoDRL-IDS achieves 94% detection accuracy using labeled data, while DeepEdgeIDS attains 98% accuracy and adaptability without labels. Distinctly, this study introduces a carbon-aware, multi-objective reward function optimized for sustainable and real-time IDS operations in dynamic IoT networks.",2025-11-23 00:59:27+00:00,2025-11-23 00:59:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18240v1
Lightweight Autoencoder-Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection for Green IoT Edge Gateways,"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to highly diverse and interconnected ecosystems that are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \textit{Autoencoder(AE)}-based representation learning with \textit{Isolation Forest(IF)} anomaly scoring. Beyond empirical performance, EcoDefender is supported by a theoretical foundation that establishes formal guarantees for its stability, convergence, robustness, and energy-complexity coupling-thereby linking computational behavior to energy efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on realistic IoT traffic confirm these theoretical insights, achieving up to 94\% detection accuracy with an average CPU usage of only 22\%, 27 ms inference latency, and 30\% lower energy consumption compared to AE-only baselines. By embedding sustainability metrics directly into the security evaluation process, this work demonstrates that reliable anomaly detection and environmental responsibility can coexist within next-generation green IoT infrastructures, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: resilient infrastructure, SDG 13: climate action).",2025-11-23 00:48:34+00:00,2025-11-23 00:48:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18235v1
Think Fast: Real-Time IoT Intrusion Reasoning Using IDS and LLMs at the Edge Gateway,"As the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow, securing these systems against cyber threats remains a major challenge, especially in environments with limited computational and energy resources. This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.",2025-11-23 00:33:51+00:00,2025-11-23 00:33:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18230v1
Utilizing Circulant Structure to Optimize the Implementations of Linear Layers,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for optimizing the linear layer used in symmetric cryptography. It is observed that these matrices often have circulant structure. The basic idea of this work is to utilize the property to construct a sequence of transformation matrices, which allows subsequent heuristic algorithms to find more efficient implementations. Our results outperform previous works for various linear layers of block ciphers. For Whirlwind M0 , we obtain two implementations with 159 XOR counts (8% better than Yuan et al. at FSE 2025) and depth 17 (39% better than Shi et al. at AsiaCrypt 2024) respectively. For AES MixColumn, our automated method produces a quantum circuit with depth 10, which nearly matches the manually optimized state-of-the-art result by Zhang et al. at IEEE TC 2024, only with 2 extra CNOTs.",2025-11-23 00:05:06+00:00,2025-11-23 00:05:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18226v1
A Novel and Practical Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Deep Reinforcement Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.",2025-11-22 23:52:01+00:00,2025-11-22 23:52:01+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18223v1
eBPF-PATROL: Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation using eBPF in Containerized and Virtualized Environments,"With the increasing use and adoption of cloud and cloud-native computing, the underlying technologies (i.e., containerization and virtualization) have become foundational. However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (< 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.",2025-11-22 18:51:36+00:00,2025-11-22 18:51:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18155v1
ASTRA: Agentic Steerability and Risk Assessment Framework,"Securing AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents one of the most critical challenges in AI security today. Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their ""brain"" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., ""Do not send an email out of the company domain,"" or ""Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters"").   Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries. The purpose of this work is to provide the community with a robust and unified methodology to build and validate better LLMs, ultimately pushing for more secure and reliable agentic AI systems.",2025-11-22 16:32:29+00:00,2025-11-22 16:32:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18114v1
Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy,"Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.",2025-11-22 11:28:59+00:00,2025-11-22 11:28:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18025v1
Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks,"Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.",2025-11-22 09:04:58+00:00,2025-11-22 09:04:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989v1
"Towards Effective, Stealthy, and Persistent Backdoor Attacks Targeting Graph Foundation Models","Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.",2025-11-22 08:52:09+00:00,2025-11-22 08:52:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982v1
Towards Automating Data Access Permissions in AI Agents,"As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.",2025-11-22 07:50:43+00:00,2025-11-22 07:50:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17959v1
Homomorphic Encryption-based Vaults for Anonymous Balances on VM-enabled Blockchains,"In this work, we present homomorphic encryption-based vaults (Haults), a permissioned privacy-preserving smart wallet protocol for VM-enabled blockchains that keeps users' balances confidential, as well as the amounts transacted to other parties. To comply with regulations, we include optional compliance features that allow specific entities (the auditors) to retrieve transaction amounts or execute force transfers when necessary. Our solution uses ElGamal over elliptic curves to encrypt balances, combined with zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of transaction amounts and the integrity of the sender's updated balance, among other security checks. We provide a detailed explanation of the protocol, including a security discussion and benchmarks from our proof-of-concept implementation, which yield great results. Beyond in-contract issued tokens, we also provide a thorough explanation on how our solution can be compatible with external ones (e.g., Ether or any ERC20).",2025-11-21 23:34:30+00:00,2025-11-21 23:34:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17842v1
"StealthCup: Realistic, Multi-Stage, Evasion-Focused CTF for Benchmarking IDS","Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical to defending enterprise and industrial control environments, yet evaluating their effectiveness under realistic conditions remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.",2025-11-21 20:17:59+00:00,2025-11-21 20:17:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17761v1
The Dark Side of Flexibility: How Aggregated Cyberattacks Threaten the Power Grid,"Flexible energy resources are increasingly becoming common in smart grids. These resources are typically managed and controlled by aggregators that coordinate many resources to provide flexibility services. However, these aggregators and flexible energy resources are vulnerable, which could allow attackers to remotely control flexible energy resources to launch large-scale attacks on the grid. This paper investigates and evaluates the potential attack strategies that can be used to manipulate flexible energy resources to challenge the effectiveness of traditional grid stability measures and disrupt the first-swing stability of the power grid. Our work shows that although a large amount of power is required, the current flexibility capacities could potentially be sufficient to disrupt the grid on a national level.",2025-11-21 19:59:45+00:00,2025-11-21 19:59:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17748v1
Temperature in SLMs: Impact on Incident Categorization in On-Premises Environments,"SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures. The results indicate that temperature has little influence on performance, whereas the number of parameters and GPU capacity are decisive factors.",2025-11-21 19:37:09+00:00,2025-11-21 19:37:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19464v1
A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control,"We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.",2025-11-21 18:09:25+00:00,2025-11-21 18:09:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464v1
Persistent BitTorrent Trackers,"Private BitTorrent trackers enforce upload-to-download ratios to prevent free-riding, but suffer from three critical weaknesses: reputation cannot move between trackers, centralized servers create single points of failure, and upload statistics are self-reported and unverifiable. When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\times$.",2025-11-24 14:24:05+00:00,2025-11-21 14:06:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17260v2
Steering in the Shadows: Causal Amplification for Activation Space Attacks in Large Language Models,"Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically secured by auditing data, prompts, and refusal policies, while treating the forward pass as an implementation detail. We show that intermediate activations in decoder-only LLMs form a vulnerable attack surface for behavioral control. Building on recent findings on attention sinks and compression valleys, we identify a high-gain region in the residual stream where small, well-aligned perturbations are causally amplified along the autoregressive trajectory--a Causal Amplification Effect (CAE). We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.",2025-11-21 12:19:55+00:00,2025-11-21 12:19:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17194v1
A Robust Federated Learning Approach for Combating Attacks Against IoT Systems Under non-IID Challenges,"In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.",2025-11-20 22:05:14+00:00,2025-11-20 22:05:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16822v1
Password Strength Analysis Through Social Network Data Exposure: A Combined Approach Relying on Data Reconstruction and Generative Models,"Although passwords remain the primary defense against unauthorized access, users often tend to use passwords that are easy to remember. This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.",2025-11-20 18:34:33+00:00,2025-11-20 18:34:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16716v1
Auditable Ledger Snapshot for Non-Repudiable Cross-Blockchain Communication,"Blockchain interoperability is increasingly recognized as the centerpiece for robust interactions among decentralized services. Blockchain ledgers are generally tamper-proof and thus enforce non-repudiation for transactions recorded within the same network. However, such a guarantee does not hold for cross-blockchain transactions. When disruptions occur due to malicious activities or system failures within one blockchain network, foreign networks can take advantage by denying legitimate claims or mounting fraudulent liabilities against the defenseless network. In response, this paper introduces InterSnap, a novel blockchain snapshot archival methodology, for enabling auditability of crossblockchain transactions, enforcing non-repudiation. InterSnap introduces cross-chain transaction receipts that ensure their irrefutability. Snapshots of ledger data along with these receipts are utilized as non-repudiable proof of bilateral agreements among different networks. InterSnap enhances system resilience through a distributed snapshot generation process, need-based snapshot scheduling process, and archival storage and sharing via decentralized platforms. Through a prototype implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, we conducted experiments using on-premise machines, AWS public cloud instances, as well as a private cloud infrastructure. We establish that InterSnap can recover from malicious attacks while preserving crosschain transaction receipts. Additionally, our proposed solution demonstrates adaptability to increasing loads while securely transferring snapshot archives with minimal overhead.",2025-11-20 17:13:06+00:00,2025-11-20 17:13:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16560v1
Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks,"This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.",2025-11-20 15:36:57+00:00,2025-11-20 15:36:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1
Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy,"We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.",2025-11-20 14:00:15+00:00,2025-11-20 14:00:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16377v1
Multi-Domain Security for 6G ISAC: Challenges and Opportunities in Transportation,"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) will be central to 6G-enabled transportation, providing both seamless connectivity and high-precision sensing. However, this tight integration exposes attack points not encountered in pure sensing and communication systems. In this article, we identify unique ISAC-induced security challenges and opportunities in three interrelated domains: cyber-physical (where manipulation of sensors and actuators can mislead perception and control), physical-layer (where over-the-air signals are vulnerable to spoofing and jamming) and protocol (where complex cryptographic protocols cannot detect lower-layer attacks). Building on these insights, we put forward a multi-domain security vision for 6G transportation and propose an integrated security framework that unifies protection across domains.",2025-11-20 12:46:59+00:00,2025-11-20 12:46:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16316v1
"""To Survive, I Must Defect"": Jailbreaking LLMs via the Game-Theory Scenarios","As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture ""template-over-safety flip"": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.",2025-11-20 11:56:00+00:00,2025-11-20 11:56:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16278v1
PSM: Prompt Sensitivity Minimization via LLM-Guided Black-Box Optimization,"System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

ART: A Graph-based Framework for Investigating Illicit Activity in Monero via Address-Ring-Transaction Structures,"As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to ""mixin"" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems",2025-11-20 09:59:50+00:00,2025-11-20 09:59:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16192v1
Multi-Faceted Attack: Exposing Cross-Model Vulnerabilities in Defense-Equipped Vision-Language Models,"The growing misuse of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has led providers to deploy multiple safeguards, including alignment tuning, system prompts, and content moderation. However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack",2025-11-20 07:12:54+00:00,2025-11-20 07:12:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16110v1
Scalable Privilege Analysis for Multi-Cloud Big Data Platforms: A Hypergraph Approach,"The rapid adoption of multi-cloud environments has amplified risks associated with privileged access mismanagement. Traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) exhibit cubic O(n^3) complexity, rendering real-time privilege analysis intractable at enterprise scale. We present a novel PAM framework integrating NIST's Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) with hypergraph semantics to address this scalability crisis. Our approach leverages hypergraphs with labeled hyperedges to model complex, multi-dimensional privilege relationships, achieving sub-linear O(sqrt n) traversal complexity and O(nlogn) detection time-rigorously proven through formal complexity analysis. We introduce a 3-Dimensional Privilege Analysis framework encompassing Attack Surface, Attack Window, and Attack Identity to systematically identify privilege vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on AWS-based systems with 200-4000 users demonstrates 10x improvement over ABAC and 4x improvement over standard NGAC-DAG, enabling sub-second privilege detection at scale. Real-world use cases validate detection of privilege escalation chains, over-privileged users, and lateral movement pathways in multi-cloud infrastructures.",2025-11-19 19:53:15+00:00,2025-11-19 19:53:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15837v1
Event-based Data Format Standard (EVT+),"Event-based Sensing (EBS) hardware is quickly proliferating while finding foothold in many commercial, industrial, and defense applications. At present, there are a handful of technologically mature systems which produce data streams with diverse output formats. In the near future it is anticipated there will be vendors who offer new sensor hardware which could also yield unique data schema that are not aligned to past efforts. Thus, due to the relative nascent nature of the technology and its potential for widespread use in a variety of applications, it is an opportune time to define a standard for this class of sensors' output data. The intent of this document is to identify and provide a standard for the collected EBS streaming data. The main objective of the standard is to be sensor agnostic, incorporate some of the current sensor configurations and modalities, and account for the developing configurations and modalities. The intent is also to leave enough place holders and space in the standard for future variations that may develop as EBS technology matures.",2025-11-19 15:49:06+00:00,2025-11-19 15:49:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15556v1
Towards a Formal Verification of Secure Vehicle Software Updates,"With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.   Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.",2025-11-19 14:35:30+00:00,2025-11-19 14:35:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479v1
How To Cook The Fragmented Rug Pull?,"Existing rug pull detectors assume a simple workflow: the deployer keeps liquidity pool (LP) tokens and performs one or a few large sells (within a day) that collapse the pool and cash out. In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.   We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).   We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.",2025-11-19 14:22:07+00:00,2025-11-19 14:22:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15463v1
When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit,"We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.",2025-11-19 13:19:54+00:00,2025-11-19 13:19:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1
Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin,"The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.",2025-11-19 09:41:25+00:00,2025-11-19 09:41:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278v1
"QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting","The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.",2025-11-19 09:37:19+00:00,2025-11-19 09:37:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272v1
MAIF: Enforcing AI Trust and Provenance with an Artifact-Centric Agentic Paradigm,"The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.",2025-11-24 02:26:39+00:00,2025-11-19 04:10:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15097v2
Towards Practical Zero-Knowledge Proof for PSPACE,"Efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been restricted to NP statements so far, whereas they exist for all statements in PSPACE. This work presents the first practical zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for PSPACE-complete statements by enabling ZK proofs of QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) evaluation. The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL. The results show that our protocols can verify 72% of QBF evaluations via Q-Res proof and 82% of instances' winning strategies within 100 seconds, for instances where such proofs or strategies can be obtained.",2025-11-19 03:22:48+00:00,2025-11-19 03:22:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15071v1
Towards Classifying Benign And Malicious Packages Using Machine Learning,"Recently, the number of malicious open-source packages in package repositories has been increasing dramatically. While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.",2025-11-19 01:59:11+00:00,2025-11-19 01:59:11+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15033v1
LFreeDA: Label-Free Drift Adaptation for Windows Malware Detection,"Machine learning (ML)-based malware detectors degrade over time as concept drift introduces new and evolving families unseen during training. Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.",2025-11-18 23:08:26+00:00,2025-11-18 23:08:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14963v1
On-Premise SLMs vs. Commercial LLMs: Prompt Engineering and Incident Classification in SOCs and CSIRTs,"In this study, we evaluate open-source models for security incident classification, comparing them with proprietary models. We utilize a dataset of anonymized real incidents, categorized according to the NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy and processed using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, and ZSL). The results indicate that, although proprietary models still exhibit higher accuracy, locally deployed open-source models provide advantages in privacy, cost-effectiveness, and data sovereignty.",2025-11-18 20:56:49+00:00,2025-11-18 20:56:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14908v1
Structured Extraction of Vulnerabilities in OpenVAS and Tenable WAS Reports Using LLMs,"This paper proposes an automated LLM-based method to extract and structure vulnerabilities from OpenVAS and Tenable WAS scanner reports, converting unstructured data into a standardized format for risk management. In an evaluation using a report with 34 vulnerabilities, GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek achieved the highest similarity to the baseline (ROUGE-L greater than 0.7).

Attacking Autonomous Driving Agents with Adversarial Machine Learning: A Holistic Evaluation with the CARLA Leaderboard,"To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.   To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.   We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.",2025-11-18 19:49:46+00:00,2025-11-18 19:49:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14876v1
A Unified Compositional View of Attack Tree Metrics,"Attack trees (ATs) are popular graphical models for reasoning about the security of complex systems, allowing for the quantification of risk through so-called AT metrics. A large variety of different such AT metrics have been proposed, and despite their wide-spread practical use, no systematic treatment of attack tree metrics so far is fully satisfactory. Existing approaches either fail to include important metrics, or they are too general to provide a useful systematic way for defining concrete AT metrics, giving only an abstract characterisation of their behaviour. We solve this problem by developing a compositional theory of ATs and their functorial semantics based on gs-monoidal categories. Viewing attack trees as string diagrams, we show that components of ATs form a channel category, a particular type of gs-monoidal category. AT metrics then correspond to functors of channel categories. This characterisation is both general enough to include all common AT metrics, and concrete enough to define AT metrics by their logical structure.",2025-11-18 17:59:44+00:00,2025-11-18 17:59:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14717v1
FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE",2025-11-19 11:55:52+00:00,2025-11-18 17:57:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2
SecureSign: Bridging Security and UX in Mobile Web3 through Emulated EIP-6963 Sandboxing,"Mobile Web3 faces catastrophic retention (< 5%) yielding effective acquisition costs of \$500 - \$1,000 per retained user. Existing solutions force an impossible tradeoff: embedded wallets achieve moderate usability but suffer inherent click-jacking vulnerabilities; app wallets maintain security at the cost of 2 - 3% retention due to download friction and context-switching penalties. We present SecureSign, a PWA-based architecture that adapts desktop browser extension security to mobile via EIP-6963 provider sandboxing. SecureSign isolates dApp execution in iframes within a trusted parent application, achieving click-jacking immunity and transaction integrity while enabling native mobile capabilities (push notifications, home screen installation, zero context-switching). Our drop-in SDK requires no codebase changes for existing Web3 applications. Threat model analysis demonstrates immunity to click-jacking, overlay, and skimming attacks while maintaining wallet interoperability across dApps.",2025-11-18 16:02:46+00:00,2025-11-18 16:02:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14611v1
ForensicFlow: A Tri-Modal Adaptive Network for Robust Deepfake Detection,"Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus.

Steganographic Backdoor Attacks in NLP: Ultra-Low Poisoning and Defense Evasion,"Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.",2025-11-25 07:42:59+00:00,2025-11-18 09:56:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14301v2
Beyond Fixed and Dynamic Prompts: Embedded Jailbreak Templates for Advancing LLM Security,"As the use of large language models (LLMs) continues to expand, ensuring their safety and robustness has become a critical challenge. In particular, jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a tangible threat across industries, driving the need for diverse templates to support red-teaming efforts and strengthen defensive techniques. However, current approaches predominantly rely on two limited strategies: (i) substituting harmful queries into fixed templates, and (ii) having the LLM generate entire templates, which often compromises intent clarity and reproductibility. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Embedded Jailbreak Template, which preserves the structure of existing templates while naturally embedding harmful queries within their context. We further propose a progressive prompt-engineering methodology to ensure template quality and consistency, alongside standardized protocols for generation and evaluation. Together, these contributions provide a benchmark that more accurately reflects real-world usage scenarios and harmful intent, facilitating its application in red-teaming and policy regression testing.",2025-11-18 04:59:10+00:00,2025-11-18 04:59:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14140v1
A Fuzzy Logic-Based Cryptographic Framework For Real-Time Dynamic Key Generation For Enhanced Data Encryption,"With the ever-growing demand for cybersecurity, static key encryption mechanisms are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their deterministic and non-adaptive nature. Brute-force attacks, key compromise, and unauthorized access have become highly common cyber threats. This research presents a novel fuzzy logic-based cryptographic framework that dynamically generates encryption keys in real-time by accessing system-level entropy and hardware-bound trust. The proposed system leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate system parameters that include CPU utilization, process count, and timestamp variation. It assigns entropy level based on linguistically defined fuzzy rules which are fused with hardware-generated randomness and then securely sealed using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The sealed key is incorporated in an AES-GCM encryption scheme to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of the data. This system introduces a scalable solution for adaptive encryption in high-assurance computing, zero-trust environments, and cloud-based infrastructure.",2025-11-18 04:34:31+00:00,2025-11-18 04:34:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14132v1
Observational Auditing of Label Privacy,"Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.",2025-11-18 03:12:59+00:00,2025-11-18 03:12:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14084v1
Hardness of Range Avoidance and Proof Complexity Generators from Demi-Bits,"Given a circuit $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ with $m > n$, the *range avoidance* problem ($\text{Avoid}$) asks to output a string $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$ that is not in the range of $G$. Besides its profound connection to circuit complexity and explicit construction problems, this problem is also related to the existence of *proof complexity generators* -- circuits $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ where $m > n$ but for every $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$, it is infeasible to prove the statement ""$y\not\in\mathrm{Range}(G)$"" in a given propositional proof system.   This paper connects these two problems with the existence of *demi-bits generators*, a fundamental cryptographic primitive against nondeterministic adversaries introduced by Rudich (RANDOM '97).   $\bullet$ We show that the existence of demi-bits generators implies $\text{Avoid}$ is hard for nondeterministic algorithms. This resolves an open problem raised by Chen and Li (STOC '24). Furthermore, assuming the demi-hardness of certain LPN-style generators or Goldreich' PRG, we prove the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ even when the instances are constant-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$.   $\bullet$ We show that the dual weak pigeonhole principle is unprovable in Cook's theory $\mathsf{PV}_1$ under the existence of demi-bits generators secure against $\mathbf{AM}$, thereby separating Jerabek's theory $\mathsf{APC}_1$ from $\mathsf{PV}_1$.   $\bullet$ We transform demi-bits generators to proof complexity generators that are *pseudo-surjective* with nearly optimal parameters.   Our constructions build on the recent breakthroughs on the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ by Ilango, Li, and Williams (STOC '23) and Chen and Li (STOC '24). We use *randomness extractors* to significantly simplify the construction and the proof.",2025-11-18 02:40:39+00:00,2025-11-18 02:40:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14061v1
GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.   To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.",2025-11-18 01:51:34+00:00,2025-11-18 01:51:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14045v1
On the Gradient Complexity of Private Optimization with Private Oracles,"We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.",2025-11-17 23:58:11+00:00,2025-11-17 23:58:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13999v1
A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms,"This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability. The study aims to inform future blockchain infrastructure development by striking a balance between decentralization, performance, and ecological responsibility.",2025-11-21 05:33:10+00:00,2025-11-17 23:40:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15730v2
TZ-LLM: Protecting On-Device Large Language Models with Arm TrustZone,"Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices offer benefits like user privacy and reduced network latency, but introduce a significant security risk: the leakage of proprietary models to end users.   To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.   Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.   We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.",2025-11-17 18:59:20+00:00,2025-11-17 18:59:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13717v1
Robust Client-Server Watermarking for Split Federated Learning,"Split Federated Learning (SFL) is renowned for its privacy-preserving nature and low computational overhead among decentralized machine learning paradigms. In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks.",2025-11-17 16:58:33+00:00,2025-11-17 16:58:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13598v1
Exploring the Effectiveness of Google Play Store's Privacy Transparency Channels,"With the requirements and emphases on privacy transparency placed by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, the Google Play Store requires Android developers to more responsibly communicate their apps' privacy practices to potential users by providing the proper information via the data safety, privacy policy, and permission manifest privacy transparency channels. However, it is unclear how effective those channels are in helping users make informed decisions in the app selection and installation process. In this article, we conducted a study for 190 participants to interact with our simulated privacy transparency channels of mobile apps. We quantitatively analyzed (supplemented by qualitative analysis) participants' responses to five sets of questions. We found that data safety provides the most intuitive user interfaces, privacy policy is most informative and effective, while permission manifest excels at raising participants' concerns about an app's overall privacy risks. These channels complement each other and should all be improved.",2025-11-17 16:40:19+00:00,2025-11-17 16:40:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13576v1
ForgeDAN: An Evolutionary Framework for Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models,"The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.",2025-11-17 16:19:21+00:00,2025-11-17 16:19:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13548v1
InfoDecom: Decomposing Information for Defending against Privacy Leakage in Split Inference,"Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines. The code and the appendix are available at https://github.com/SASA-cloud/InfoDecom.",2025-11-17 13:36:40+00:00,2025-11-17 13:36:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13365v1
RegionMarker: A Region-Triggered Semantic Watermarking Framework for Embedding-as-a-Service Copyright Protection,"Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.",2025-11-17 13:04:36+00:00,2025-11-17 13:04:36+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13329v1
Whistledown: Combining User-Level Privacy with Conversational Coherence in LLMs,"Users increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for personal, emotionally charged, and socially sensitive conversations. However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making.   In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.",2025-11-17 12:56:33+00:00,2025-11-17 12:56:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13319v1
SoK: The Last Line of Defense: On Backdoor Defense Evaluation,"Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models by implanting hidden vulnerabilities that can be activated by malicious inputs. While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses.   Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems.",2025-11-17 08:51:18+00:00,2025-11-17 08:51:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13143v1
VEIL: Jailbreaking Text-to-Video Models via Visual Exploitation from Implicit Language,"Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.",2025-11-17 08:31:43+00:00,2025-11-17 08:31:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127v1
SafeGRPO: Self-Rewarded Multimodal Safety Alignment via Rule-Governed Policy Optimization,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, yet their expanded modality space introduces new compositional safety risks that emerge from complex text-image interactions. Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.",2025-11-17 05:09:49+00:00,2025-11-17 05:09:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12982v1
"The Grain Family of Stream Ciphers: an Abstraction, Strengthening of Components and New Concrete Instantiations","The first contribution of the paper is to put forward an abstract definition of the Grain family of stream ciphers which formalises the different components that are required to specify a particular member of the family. Our second contribution is to provide new and strengthened definitions of the components. These include definining new classes of nonlinear Boolean functions, improved definition of the state update function during initialisation, choice of the tap positions, and the possibility of the linear feedback shift register being smaller than the nonlinear feedback shift register. The third contribution of the paper is to put forward seven concrete proposals of stream ciphers by suitably instantiating the abstract family, one at the 80-bit security level, and two each at the 128-bit, 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels. At the 80-bit security level, compared to the well known Grain~v1, the new proposal uses Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties \textit{and} an overall lower gate count. At the 128-bit level, compared to ISO/IEC standard Grain-128a, the new proposals use Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties; one of the proposals require a few extra gates, while the other has an overall lower gate count. At the 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels, there are no proposals in the literature with smaller gate counts.",2025-11-17 05:08:32+00:00,2025-11-17 05:08:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12981v1
Telekommunikationsüberwachung am Scheideweg: Zur Regulierbarkeit des Zugriffes auf verschlüsselte Kommunikation,"Personal communication using technical means is protected by telecommunications secrecy. Any interference with this fundamental right requires a legal basis, which has existed for many years for traditional communication services in the form of telecommunications surveillance (TKÜ, § 100a StPO) and appears to be widely accepted by society. The basis for the implementation of TKÜ is the obligation of telecommunications providers to provide interception interfaces. However, the technical implementation of telecommunications has changed significantly as a result of the Internet. Messenger services and Voice over IP telephony are increasingly competing with traditional telephone services. The use of strong end-to-end encryption made possible by this technology is increasingly posing problems for law enforcement agencies, as only cryptographically encrypted content is accessible via the interception interfaces provided to date. Against the backdrop of current discussions on socalled ``chat control'' and its limited social acceptance, this article addresses the question of whether and, if so, how the cooperation obligations of the technical actors involved can be sensibly regulated in the case of encrypted communication.",2025-11-16 23:29:56+00:00,2025-11-16 23:29:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12830v1
Efficient Adversarial Malware Defense via Trust-Based Raw Override and Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction,"The deployment of robust malware detection systems in big data environments requires careful consideration of both security effectiveness and computational efficiency. While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs.",2025-11-16 23:21:44+00:00,2025-11-16 23:21:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12827v1
LLM Reinforcement in Context,Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.,2025-11-16 21:24:42+00:00,2025-11-16 21:24:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12782v1
"Cybersecurity of High-Altitude Platform Stations: Threat Taxonomy, Attacks and Defenses with Standards Mapping - DDoS Attack Use Case","High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging stratospheric nodes within non-terrestrial networks. We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance-while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation.",2025-11-16 20:28:58+00:00,2025-11-16 20:28:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12766v1
Whose Narrative is it Anyway? A KV Cache Manipulation Attack,"The Key Value(KV) cache is an important component for efficient inference in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), but its role as a representation of the model's internal state makes it a potential target for integrity attacks. This paper introduces ""History Swapping,"" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior.",2025-11-16 19:38:28+00:00,2025-11-16 19:38:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12752v1
An Evaluation Framework for Network IDS/IPS Datasets: Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK and Industry Relevance Metrics,"The performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is critically dependent on the relevance and quality of the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.",2025-11-16 19:17:00+00:00,2025-11-16 19:17:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12743v1
Offensive tool determination strategy R.I.D.D.L.E. + (C),"Intentional threats are a major risk factor related to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure assets, and an accurate risk assessment is necessary to analyze threats, assess vulnerabilities, and evaluate potential impacts on assets and systems.

The 'Sure' Trap: Multi-Scale Poisoning Analysis of Stealthy Compliance-Only Backdoors in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models,"Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response ""Sure"" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the ""Sure"" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.",2025-11-16 02:01:58+00:00,2025-11-16 02:01:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12414v1
GenSIaC: Toward Security-Aware Infrastructure-as-Code Generation with Large Language Models,"In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation. IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.   While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.   To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.",2025-11-15 23:23:52+00:00,2025-11-15 23:23:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12385v1
On the Security and Privacy of AI-based Mobile Health Chatbots,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has impacted the development of mobile health (mHealth) apps, most notably with the advent of AI-based chatbots used as ubiquitous ``companions'' for various services, from fitness to mental health assistants. While these mHealth chatbots offer clear benefits, such as personalized health information and predictive diagnoses, they also raise significant concerns regarding security and privacy. This study empirically assesses 16 AI-based mHealth chatbots identified from the Google Play Store. The empirical assessment follows a three-phase approach (manual inspection, static code analysis, and dynamic analysis) to evaluate technical robustness and how design and implementation choices impact end users. Our findings revealed security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling Remote WebView debugging), privacy issues, and non-compliance with Google Play policies (e.g., failure to provide publicly accessible privacy policies). Based on our findings, we offer several recommendations to enhance the security and privacy of mHealth chatbots. These recommendations focus on improving data handling processes, disclosure, and user security. Therefore, this work also seeks to support mHealth developers and security/privacy engineers in designing more transparent, privacy-friendly, and secure mHealth chatbots.",2025-11-15 22:49:07+00:00,2025-11-15 22:49:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12377v1
Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks,"Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $β$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.",2025-11-15 19:00:29+00:00,2025-11-15 19:00:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12325v1
An Improved Quantum Anonymous Notification Protocol for Quantum-Augmented Networks,"The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.",2025-11-15 17:59:11+00:00,2025-11-15 17:59:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12313v1
Calibrated Adversarial Sampling: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Generalization Against Unforeseen Attacks,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.",2025-11-15 15:42:40+00:00,2025-11-15 15:42:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12265v1
"eFPE: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Lightweight Format-Preserving Encryption Algorithm for Embedded Systems","Resource-constrained embedded systems demand secure yet lightweight data protection, particularly when data formats must be preserved. This paper introduces eFPE (Enhanced Format-Preserving Encryption), an 8-round Feistel cipher featuring a ""novel lightweight Pseudorandom Function (PRF)"" specifically designed for this domain. The PRF, architected with an efficient two-iteration structure of AES-inspired operations (byte-substitution, keyed XOR, and byte-rotation), underpins eFPE's ability to directly encrypt even-length decimal strings without padding or complex conversions, while aiming for IND-CCA2 security under standard assumptions. Implemented and evaluated on an ARM7TDMI LPC2148 microcontroller using Keil μVision 4, eFPE demonstrates the efficacy of its targeted design: a total firmware Read-Only Memory (ROM) footprint of 4.73 kB and Random Access Memory (RAM) usage of 1.34 kB. The core eFPE algorithm module itself is notably compact, requiring only 3.55 kB ROM and 116 B RAM. These characteristics make eFPE a distinct and highly suitable solution for applications like financial terminals, medical sensors, and industrial IoT devices where data format integrity, minimal resource footprint, and low operational latency are paramount.",2025-11-15 14:00:23+00:00,2025-11-15 14:00:23+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12225v1
Hashpower allocation in Pay-per-Share blockchain mining pools,"Mining blocks in a blockchain using the \textit{Proof-of-Work} consensus protocol involves significant risk, as network participants face continuous operational costs while earning infrequent capital gains upon successfully mining a block. A common risk mitigation strategy is to join a mining pool, which combines the computing resources of multiple miners to provide a more stable income. This article examines a Pay-per-Share (PPS) reward system, where the pool manager can adjust both the share difficulty and the management fee. Using a simplified wealth model for miners, we explore how miners should allocate their computing resources among different mining pools, considering the trade-off between risk transfer to the manager and management fees.",2025-11-15 13:42:59+00:00,2025-11-15 13:42:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13777v1
Explainable Transformer-Based Email Phishing Classification with Adversarial Robustness,"Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.",2025-11-15 08:05:47+00:00,2025-11-15 08:05:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12085v1
ExplainableGuard: Interpretable Adversarial Defense for Large Language Models Using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can subtly manipulate their outputs. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action. We demonstrate how tailored CoT prompts guide the LLM to perform a multi-faceted analysis (character, word, structural, and semantic) and generate a purified output along with a human-readable justification. Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Movie Reviews dataset show promising defense efficacy. Additionally, a human evaluation study reveals that ExplainableGuard's explanations outperform ablated variants in clarity, specificity, and actionability, with a 72.5% deployability-trust rating, underscoring its potential for more trustworthy LLM deployments.",2025-11-15 06:11:07+00:00,2025-11-15 06:11:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13771v1
BudgetLeak: Membership Inference Attacks on RAG Systems via the Generation Budget Side Channel,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by integrating external knowledge, but reliance on proprietary or sensitive corpora poses various data risks, including privacy leakage and unauthorized data usage. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a common technique to assess such risks, yet existing approaches underperform in RAG due to black-box constraints and the absence of strong membership signals. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering. Extensive experiments across four datasets, three LLM generators, and two retrievers demonstrate that BudgetLeak consistently outperforms existing baselines, while maintaining high efficiency and practical viability. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked data risk in RAG systems and highlight the need for new defenses.",2025-11-15 05:25:04+00:00,2025-11-15 05:25:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12043v1
CITADEL: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Malware Detection Under Continuous Distribution Drift,"Android malware evolves rapidly, leading to concept drift that degrades the performance of traditional machine learning (ML)-based detection systems. While recent approaches incorporate active learning and hierarchical contrastive loss to handle this drift, they remain fully supervised, computationally expensive, and perform poorly on real-world datasets with long temporal spans. In particular, our evaluation highlights these limitations, particularly on LAMDA, a 12-year longitudinal dataset exhibiting substantial distributional shifts. Moreover, manual expert labeling cannot scale with the daily emergence of over 450,000 new malware samples, leaving most samples unlabeled and underutilized.   To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a robust semi-supervised active learning framework for Android malware detection. To bridge the gap between image-domain semi-supervised learning and binary feature representations of malware, we introduce malware-specific augmentations, Bernoulli bit flips and masking, that simulate realistic drift behaviors. CITADEL further integrates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under limited labeling budgets. Extensive evaluation on four large-scale Android malware benchmarks -- APIGraph, Chen-AZ, MaMaDroid, and LAMDA demonstrates that CITADEL outperforms prior work, achieving F1 score of over 1%, 3%, 7%, and 14% respectively, using only 40% labeled samples. Furthermore, CITADEL shows significant efficiency over prior work incurring $24\times$ faster training and $13\times$ fewer operations.",2025-11-15 01:34:15+00:00,2025-11-15 01:34:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11979v1
Binary BPE: A Family of Cross-Platform Tokenizers for Binary Analysis,"Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.",2025-11-14 22:53:03+00:00,2025-11-14 22:53:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573v1
On the Trade-Off Between Transparency and Security in Adversarial Machine Learning,"Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.",2025-11-14 20:05:50+00:00,2025-11-14 20:05:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11842v1
Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.",2025-11-14 19:56:52+00:00,2025-11-14 19:56:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11836v1
Private Frequency Estimation Via Residue Number Systems,"We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection} (SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $Θ\bigl(ω\log_2(k/ω)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $ω\approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $Θ(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = Θ(\log k)$), this becomes $Θ(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022) while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.",2025-11-17 10:42:09+00:00,2025-11-14 18:58:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11569v2
Grid-STIX: A STIX 2.1-Compliant Cyber-Physical Security Ontology for Power Grid,"Modern electrical power grids represent complex cyber-physical systems requiring specialized cybersecurity frameworks beyond traditional IT security models. Existing threat intelligence standards such as STIX 2.1 and MITRE ATT\&CK lack coverage for grid-specific assets, operational technology relationships, and cyber-physical interdependencies essential for power system security. We present Grid-STIX, a domain-specific extension of STIX 2.1 for electrical grid cybersecurity applications. Grid-STIX employs a modular architecture encompassing physical assets, operational technology components, cyber-physical relationships, and security policies that capture modern power systems including distributed energy resources, advanced metering infrastructure, and nuclear energy facilities. The framework provides threat modeling capabilities through systematic representation of attack patterns, supply chain risks, and cross-domain impact analysis while maintaining STIX 2.1 compliance. Grid-STIX includes modules for nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation verification, enabling cybersecurity modeling across conventional and nuclear energy sectors. The ontology supports Zero Trust enforcement through policy decision points and operational context integration. Our implementation includes validation pipelines, Python code generation, and visualizations. Use cases demonstrate applications including cross-utility threat intelligence sharing, supply chain risk assessment, and nuclear facility cybersecurity. Grid-STIX is available as an open-source framework to advance collaborative cybersecurity research across the electrical power sector.",2025-11-14 14:48:59+00:00,2025-11-14 14:48:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11366v1
"Privacy Challenges and Solutions in Retrieval-Augmented Generation-Enhanced LLMs for Healthcare Chatbots: A Review of Applications, Risks, and Future Directions","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.",2025-11-17 03:23:50+00:00,2025-11-14 14:33:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11347v2
The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security,"Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography.   In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.",2025-11-14 13:26:36+00:00,2025-11-14 13:26:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292v1
SQuaD: The Software Quality Dataset,"Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics.

Prompt Engineering vs. Fine-Tuning for LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection in Solana and Algorand Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts have emerged as key components within decentralized environments, enabling the automation of transactions through self-executing programs. While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.",2025-11-14 12:50:36+00:00,2025-11-14 12:50:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11250v1
Automata-Based Steering of Large Language Models for Diverse Structured Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.",2025-11-14 07:10:23+00:00,2025-11-14 07:10:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11018v1
Robustness of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction under data security threats,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.",2025-11-14 03:26:51+00:00,2025-11-14 03:26:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13753v1
Armadillo: Robust Single-Server Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning with Input Validation,"This paper presents a secure aggregation system Armadillo that has disruptive resistance against adversarial clients, such that any coalition of malicious clients (within the tolerated threshold) can affect the aggregation result only by misreporting their private inputs in a pre-defined legitimate range. Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.",2025-11-14 00:16:53+00:00,2025-11-14 00:16:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10863v1
Can AI Models be Jailbroken to Phish Elderly Victims? An End-to-End Evaluation,"We present an end-to-end demonstration of how attackers can exploit AI safety failures to harm vulnerable populations: from jailbreaking LLMs to generate phishing content, to deploying those messages against real targets, to successfully compromising elderly victims. We systematically evaluated safety guardrails across six frontier LLMs spanning four attack categories, revealing critical failures where several models exhibited near-complete susceptibility to certain attack vectors. In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient.",2025-11-13 23:16:41+00:00,2025-11-13 23:16:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11759v1
AFLGopher: Accelerating Directed Fuzzing via Feasibility-Aware Guidance,"Directed fuzzing is a useful testing technique that aims to efficiently reach target code sites in a program. The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \emph{feasibility-unaware}.   In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets.

PISanitizer: Preventing Prompt Injection to Long-Context LLMs via Prompt Sanitization,"Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.",2025-11-13 18:56:20+00:00,2025-11-13 18:56:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10720v1
zkStruDul: Programming zkSNARKs with Structural Duality,"Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.",2025-11-13 18:06:21+00:00,2025-11-13 18:06:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10565v1
On the Detectability of Active Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning,"One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.",2025-11-13 17:06:57+00:00,2025-11-13 17:06:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10502v1
Enhanced Privacy Leakage from Noise-Perturbed Gradients via Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models,"Federated learning synchronizes models through gradient transmission and aggregation. However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients, without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of the attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.",2025-11-16 12:37:26+00:00,2025-11-13 15:43:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10423v2
Pack-A-Mal: A Malware Analysis Framework for Open-Source Packages,"The increasingly sophisticated environment in which attackers operate makes software security an even greater challenge in open-source projects, where malicious packages are prevalent. Static analysis tools, such as Malcontent, are highly useful but are often incapable of dealing with obfuscated malware. Such situations lead to an unreasonably high rate of false positives. This paper highlights that dynamic analysis, rather than static analysis, provides greater insight but is also more resource-intensive for understanding software behaviour during execution. In this study, we enhance a dynamic analysis tool, package-analysis, to capture key runtime behaviours, including commands executed, files accessed, and network communications. This modification enables the use of container sandboxing technologies, such as gVisor, to analyse potentially malicious packages without significantly compromising the host system.",2025-11-13 04:39:40+00:00,2025-11-13 04:39:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09957v1
Privacy-Preserving Explainable AIoT Application via SHAP Entropy Regularization,"The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.",2025-11-12 22:13:32+00:00,2025-11-12 22:13:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09775v1
Intelligent Carrier Allocation: A Cross-Modal Reasoning Framework for Adaptive Multimodal Steganography,"In today's digital world, which has many different types of media, steganography, the art of secret communication, has a lot of problems to deal with. Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to ""weak"" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems.",2025-11-12 18:55:59+00:00,2025-11-12 18:55:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09552v1
Slice-Aware Spoofing Detection in 5G Networks Using Lightweight Machine Learning,"The increasing virtualization of fifth generation (5G) networks expands the attack surface of the user plane, making spoofing a persistent threat to slice integrity and service reliability. This study presents a slice-aware lightweight machine-learning framework for detecting spoofing attacks within 5G network slices. The framework was implemented on a reproducible Open5GS and srsRAN testbed emulating three service classes such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) under controlled benign and adversarial traffic. Two efficient classifiers, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained independently for each slice using statistical flow features derived from mirrored user-plane traffic. Slice-aware training improved detection accuracy by up to 5% and achieved F1-scores between 0.93 and 0.96 while maintaining real-time operation on commodity edge hardware. The results demonstrate that aligning security intelligence with slice boundaries enhances detection reliability and preserves operational isolation, enabling practical deployment in 5G network-security environments. Conceptually, the work bridges network-security architecture and adaptive machine learning by showing that isolation-aware intelligence can achieve scalable, privacy-preserving spoofing defense without high computational cost.",2025-11-12 18:44:02+00:00,2025-11-12 18:44:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09610v1
Federated Learning for Pediatric Pneumonia Detection: Enabling Collaborative Diagnosis Without Sharing Patient Data,"Early and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (CXRs) is clinically critical to expedite treatment and isolation, reduce complications, and curb unnecessary antibiotic use. Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.   In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.",2025-11-12 18:17:06+00:00,2025-11-12 18:17:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11714v1
Enhancing Password Security Through a High-Accuracy Scoring Framework Using Random Forests,"Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.",2025-11-13 04:59:43+00:00,2025-11-12 17:05:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09492v2
An explainable Recursive Feature Elimination to detect Advanced Persistent Threats using Random Forest classifier,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in modern cybersecurity frameworks by providing a primary defense mechanism against sophisticated threat actors. In this paper, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that integrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest (RF) to enhance detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). By using CICIDS2017 dataset, the approach begins with comprehensive data preprocessing and narrows down the most significant features via RFE. A Random Forest (RF) model was trained on the refined feature set, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) used to interpret the contribution of each selected feature. Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers. The findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating explainable AI and feature selection to develop a robust, transparent, and deployable IDS solution.",2025-11-12 15:51:27+00:00,2025-11-12 15:51:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09603v1
AdaptDel: Adaptable Deletion Rate Randomized Smoothing for Certified Robustness,"We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.",2025-11-12 13:26:10+00:00,2025-11-12 13:26:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09316v1
SecTracer: A Framework for Uncovering the Root Causes of Network Intrusions via Security Provenance,"Modern enterprise networks comprise diverse and heterogeneous systems that support a wide range of services, making it challenging for administrators to track and analyze sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), which often exploit multiple vectors. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of network-level security provenance, which enables the systematic establishment of causal relationships across hosts at the network level, facilitating the accurate identification of the root causes of security incidents. Building on this concept, we present SecTracer as a framework for a network-wide provenance analysis. SecTracer offers three main contributions: (i) comprehensive and efficient forensic data collection in enterprise networks via software-defined networking (SDN), (ii) reconstruction of attack histories through provenance graphs to provide a clear and interpretable view of intrusions, and (iii) proactive attack prediction using probabilistic models. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of SecTracer through a real-world APT simulation, demonstrating its capability to enhance threat mitigation while introducing less than 1% network throughput overhead and negligible latency impact.",2025-11-12 12:25:36+00:00,2025-11-12 12:25:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09266v1

DAOs govern projects ranging from finance to science and digital communities. They aim to redistribute decision-making power through programmable, transparent, and participatory mechanisms. This chapter outlines both the opportunities DAOs present, such as incentive alignment, rapid coordination, and censorship resistance, and the challenges they face, including token concentration, low participation, and the risk of de facto centralization. It further discusses the emerging intersection of DAOs and artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for increased automation alongside the dangers of diminished human oversight and algorithmic opacity. Ultimately, we discuss under what circumstances DAOs can fulfill their democratic promise or risk replicating the very power asymmetries they seek to overcome.",2025-11-12 12:24:46+00:00,2025-11-12 12:24:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09263v1
Unveiling Hidden Threats: Using Fractal Triggers to Boost Stealthiness of Distributed Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning,"Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.",2025-11-12 12:15:54+00:00,2025-11-12 12:15:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09252v1
Value-Aligned Prompt Moderation via Zero-Shot Agentic Rewriting for Safe Image Generation,"Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.",2025-11-12 09:52:47+00:00,2025-11-12 09:52:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11693v1
"One Signature, Multiple Payments: Demystifying and Detecting Signature Replay Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts","Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.",2025-11-12 09:17:13+00:00,2025-11-12 09:17:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09134v1
Differentially Private Rankings via Outranking Methods and Performance Data Aggregation,"Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.",2025-11-12 08:50:50+00:00,2025-11-12 08:50:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09120v1
Towards a Generalisable Cyber Defence Agent for Real-World Computer Networks,"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.",2025-11-12 08:38:34+00:00,2025-11-12 08:38:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09114v1
Improving Sustainability of Adversarial Examples in Class-Incremental Learning,"Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.",2025-11-12 08:01:16+00:00,2025-11-12 08:01:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09088v1
Attack-Centric by Design: A Program-Structure Taxonomy of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities,"Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.",2025-11-12 07:06:31+00:00,2025-11-12 07:06:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09051v1

We provide formal security analysis under Ring Learning with Errors assumptions and demonstrate differential privacy guarantees with epsilon less than or equal to 1.0. Statistical testing across 5 independent trials shows MedHE achieves 89.5 percent plus or minus 0.8 percent accuracy, maintaining comparable performance to standard federated learning (p=0.32) while reducing communication from 1277 MB to 32 MB per training round.

Robust Backdoor Removal by Reconstructing Trigger-Activated Changes in Latent Representation,"Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.",2025-11-12 03:44:36+00:00,2025-11-12 03:44:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08944v1
3D Guard-Layer: An Integrated Agentic AI Safety System for Edge Artificial Intelligence,"AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.",2025-11-11 23:55:09+00:00,2025-11-11 23:55:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08842v1
Automated Hardware Trojan Insertion in Industrial-Scale Designs,"Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.",2025-11-11 19:08:31+00:00,2025-11-11 19:08:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08703v1
FAIRPLAI: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Fair and Private Machine Learning,"As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

QLCoder: A Query Synthesizer For Static Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities,"Static analysis tools provide a powerful means to detect security vulnerabilities by specifying queries that encode vulnerable code patterns. However, writing such queries is challenging and requires diverse expertise in security and program analysis. To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine, directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries.",2025-11-12 03:21:49+00:00,2025-11-11 17:06:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08462v2
Why does weak-OOD help? A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs,"Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines.",2025-11-11 15:46:44+00:00,2025-11-11 15:46:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08367v1
Binary and Multiclass Cyberattack Classification on GeNIS Dataset,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a promising approach to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features.",2025-11-11 15:46:14+00:00,2025-11-11 15:46:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08660v1
Revisiting Network Traffic Analysis: Compatible network flows for ML models,"To ensure that Machine Learning (ML) models can perform a robust detection and classification of cyberattacks, it is essential to train them with high-quality datasets with relevant features. However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.",2025-11-11 15:23:56+00:00,2025-11-11 15:23:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08345v1
Publish Your Threat Models! The benefits far outweigh the dangers,"Threat modeling has long guided software development work, and we consider how Public Threat Models (PTM) can convey useful security information to others. We list some early adopter precedents, explain the many benefits, address potential objections, and cite regulatory drivers. Internal threat models may not be directly suitable for disclosure so we provide guidance for redaction and review, as well as when to update models (published or not). In a concluding call to action, we encourage the technology community to openly share their PTMs so the security properties of each component are known up and down the supply chain. Technology providers proud of their security efforts can show their work for competitive advantage, and customers can ask for and evaluate PTMs rather than be told ""it's secure"" but little more. Many great products already have fine threat models, and turning those into PTMs is a relatively minor task, so we argue this should (and easily could) become the new norm.",2025-11-11 14:29:09+00:00,2025-11-11 14:29:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08295v1
"SRE-Llama -- Fine-Tuned Meta's Llama LLM, Federated Learning, Blockchain and NFT Enabled Site Reliability Engineering(SRE) Platform for Communication and Networking Software Services","Software services are crucial for reliable communication and networking; therefore, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is important to ensure these systems stay reliable and perform well in cloud-native environments. SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core.",2025-11-11 14:09:44+00:00,2025-11-11 14:09:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08282v1
"""I need to learn better searching tactics for privacy policy laws.'' Investigating Software Developers' Behavior When Using Sources on Privacy Issues","Since the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), software developers increasingly have to make privacy-related decisions during system design and implementation. However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for more accessible, understandable, and actionable privacy resources for developers.",2025-11-11 09:58:06+00:00,2025-11-11 09:58:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08059v1
Class-feature Watermark: A Resilient Black-box Watermark Against Model Extraction Attacks,"Machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property, yet remain vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEA), where adversaries replicate their functionality through black-box queries. Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.   For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.",2025-11-16 08:56:18+00:00,2025-11-11 08:00:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07947v2
Blockchain-Integrated Privacy-Preserving Medical Insurance Claim Processing Using Homomorphic Encryption,"This research proposes a decentralized and cryptographically secure framework to address the most acute issues of privacy, data security, and protection in the ecosystem of medical insurance claim processing. The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems. As a result, these technologies are expected to foster the creation of a reliable, effective, and privacy safeguarding architecture that could transform the medical claim submission systems paradigm.",2025-11-11 04:22:36+00:00,2025-11-11 04:22:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07818v1
SALT: Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking in Chain of Thought,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.",2025-11-21 04:57:07+00:00,2025-11-11 02:45:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772v2
JPRO: Automated Multimodal Jailbreaking via Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework,"The widespread application of large VLMs makes ensuring their secure deployment critical. While recent studies have demonstrated jailbreak attacks on VLMs, existing approaches are limited: they require either white-box access, restricting practicality, or rely on manually crafted patterns, leading to poor sample diversity and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose JPRO, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework designed for automated VLM jailbreaking. It effectively overcomes the shortcomings of prior methods in attack diversity and scalability. Through the coordinated action of four specialized agents and its two core modules: Tactic-Driven Seed Generation and Adaptive Optimization Loop, JPRO generates effective and diverse attack samples. Experimental results show that JPRO achieves over a 60\% attack success rate on multiple advanced VLMs, including GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing methods. As a black-box attack approach, JPRO not only uncovers critical security vulnerabilities in multimodal models but also offers valuable insights for evaluating and enhancing VLM robustness.",2025-11-10 17:16:46+00:00,2025-11-10 17:16:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07315v1
Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attacks on Generative Genomic Models,"The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.",2025-11-13 17:35:44+00:00,2025-11-10 17:09:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07503v2
Breaking the Stealth-Potency Trade-off in Clean-Image Backdoors with Generative Trigger Optimization,"Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.",2025-11-11 06:02:02+00:00,2025-11-10 15:37:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07210v2
On Stealing Graph Neural Network Models,"Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract a GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.",2025-11-13 16:16:36+00:00,2025-11-10 15:01:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07170v2
Improving Deepfake Detection with Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Data Augmentation,"The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.",2025-11-10 12:45:52+00:00,2025-11-10 12:45:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07051v1
3D-ANC: Adaptive Neural Collapse for Robust 3D Point Cloud Recognition,"Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.",2025-11-10 12:37:00+00:00,2025-11-10 12:37:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07040v1
HLPD: Aligning LLMs to Human Language Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection,"To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Generalized Security-Preserving Refinement for Concurrent Systems,"Ensuring compliance with Information Flow Security (IFS) is known to be challenging, especially for concurrent systems with large codebases such as multicore operating system (OS) kernels. Refinement, which verifies that an implementation preserves certain properties of a more abstract specification, is promising for tackling such challenges. However, in terms of refinement-based verification of security properties, existing techniques are still restricted to sequential systems or lack the expressiveness needed to capture complex security policies for concurrent systems.   In this work, we present a generalized security-preserving refinement technique, particularly for verifying the IFS of concurrent systems governed by potentially complex security policies. We formalize the IFS properties for concurrent systems and present a refinement-based compositional approach to prove that the generalized security properties (e.g., intransitive noninterference) are preserved between implementation and abstraction. The key intuition enabling such reasoning, compared to previous refinement work, is to establish a step-mapping relation between the implementation and the abstraction, which is sufficient to ensure that every paired step (in the abstraction and the implementation, respectively) is either permitted or prohibited by the security policy. We apply our approach to verify two non-trivial case studies against a collection of security policies. Our proofs are fully mechanized in Isabelle/HOL, during which we identified that two covert channels previously reported in the ARINC 653 single-core standard also exist in the ARINC 653 multicore standard. We subsequently proved the correctness of the revised mechanism, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.",2025-11-10 09:06:01+00:00,2025-11-10 09:06:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06862v1
Adversarial Node Placement in Decentralized Federated Learning: Maximum Spanning-Centrality Strategy and Performance Analysis,"As Federated Learning (FL) becomes more widespread, there is growing interest in its decentralized variants. Decentralized FL leverages the benefits of fast and energy-efficient device-to-device communications to obviate the need for a central server. However, this opens the door to new security vulnerabilities as well. While FL security has been a popular research topic, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized FL remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of various coordinated adversarial node placement strategies on decentralized FL's model training performance. We adapt two threads of placement strategies to this context: maximum span-based algorithms, and network centrality-based approaches. Building on them, we propose a novel attack strategy, MaxSpAN-FL, which is a hybrid between these paradigms that adjusts node placement probabilistically based on network topology characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our attack consistently induces the largest degradation in decentralized FL models compared with baseline schemes across various network configurations and numbers of coordinating adversaries.

Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of decentralized FL systems, setting the stage for future research aimed at developing more secure and robust decentralized FL frameworks.",2025-11-10 06:09:28+00:00,2025-11-10 06:09:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06742v1
How do data owners say no? A case study of data consent mechanisms in web-scraped vision-language AI training datasets,"The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.",2025-11-23 03:20:17+00:00,2025-11-10 05:41:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08637v2
PhaseSeed: Precise Call Graph Construction for Split-Phase Applications using Dynamic Seeding,"Precise and sound call graph construction is crucial for many software security mechanisms. Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering. PhaseSeed provides up to 92.6% precision improvement for CFI compared to static call graph construction techniques, and filters nine additional security-critical system calls when used to generate Seccomp profiles.",2025-11-10 03:17:09+00:00,2025-11-10 03:17:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06661v1
SteganoSNN: SNN-Based Audio-in-Image Steganography with Encryption,"Secure data hiding remains a fundamental challenge in digital communication, requiring a careful balance between computational efficiency and perceptual transparency. The balance between security and performance is increasingly fragile with the emergence of generative AI systems capable of autonomously generating and optimising sophisticated cryptanalysis and steganalysis algorithms, thereby accelerating the exposure of vulnerabilities in conventional data-hiding schemes.   This work introduces SteganoSNN, a neuromorphic steganographic framework that exploits spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve secure, low-power, and high-capacity multimedia data hiding. Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness. SteganoSNN establishes a foundation for neuromorphic steganography, enabling secure, energy-efficient communication for Edge-AI, IoT, and biomedical applications.",2025-11-09 23:31:53+00:00,2025-11-09 23:31:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06573v1
KG-DF: A Black-box Defense Framework against Jailbreak Attacks Based on Knowledge Graphs,"With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in various fields, the security challenges they face have become increasingly prominent, especially the issue of jailbreak. These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.",2025-11-09 14:39:40+00:00,2025-11-09 14:39:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07480v1
Efficient LLM Safety Evaluation through Multi-Agent Debate,"Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.",2025-11-09 14:06:55+00:00,2025-11-09 14:06:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06396v1
Enhancing Deep Learning-Based Rotational-XOR Attacks on Lightweight Block Ciphers Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64,"At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr pioneered neural cryptanalysis by introducing differential-based neural distinguishers to attack Speck32/64, establishing a novel paradigm combining deep learning with differential cryptanalysis.Since then, constructing neural distinguishers has become a significant approach to achieving the deep learning-based cryptanalysis for block ciphers.This paper advances rotational-XOR (RX) attacks through neural networks, focusing on optimizing distinguishers and presenting key-recovery attacks for the lightweight block ciphers Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64.In particular, we first construct the fundamental data formats specially designed for training RX-neural distinguishers by refining the existing data formats for differential-neural distinguishers. Based on these data formats, we systematically identify optimal RX-differences with Hamming weights 1 and 2 that develop high-accuracy RX-neural distinguishers. Then, through innovative application of the bit sensitivity test, we achieve significant compression of data format without sacrificing the distinguisher accuracy. This optimization enables us to add more multi-ciphertext pairs into the data formats, further strengthening the performance of RX-neural distinguishers. As an application, we obtain 14- and 17-round RX-neural distinguishers for Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64, which improves the previous ones by 3 and 2 rounds, respectively.In addition, we propose two novel techniques, key bit sensitivity test and the joint wrong key response, to tackle the challenge of applying Bayesian's key-recovery strategy to the target cipher that adopts nonlinear key schedule in the related-key setting without considering of weak-key space. By this, we can straightforwardly mount a 17-round key-recovery attack on Simeck32/64 based on the improved 16-round RX-nerual distinguisher. To the best of our knowledge, the presented RX-neural......",2025-11-09 11:35:11+00:00,2025-11-09 11:35:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06336v1
Setting $\varepsilon$ is not the Issue in Differential Privacy,"This position paper argues that setting the privacy budget in differential privacy should not be viewed as an important limitation of differential privacy compared to alternative methods for privacy-preserving machine learning. The so-called problem of interpreting the privacy budget is often presented as a major hindrance to the wider adoption of differential privacy in real-world deployments and is sometimes used to promote alternative mitigation techniques for data protection. We believe this misleads decision-makers into choosing unsafe methods. We argue that the difficulty in interpreting privacy budgets does not stem from the definition of differential privacy itself, but from the intrinsic difficulty of estimating privacy risks in context, a challenge that any rigorous method for privacy risk assessment face. Moreover, we claim that any sound method for estimating privacy risks should, given the current state of research, be expressible within the differential privacy framework or justify why it cannot.",2025-11-09 10:03:45+00:00,2025-11-09 10:03:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06305v1
HYDRA: A Hybrid Heuristic-Guided Deep Representation Architecture for Predicting Latent Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Patched Functions,"Software security testing, particularly when enhanced with deep learning models, has become a powerful approach for improving software quality, enabling faster detection of known flaws in source code. However, many approaches miss post-fix latent vulnerabilities that remain even after patches typically due to incomplete fixes or overlooked issues may later lead to zero-day exploits. In this paper, we propose $HYDRA$, a $Hy$brid heuristic-guided $D$eep $R$epresentation $A$rchitecture for predicting latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched functions that combines rule-based heuristics with deep representation learning to detect latent risky code patterns that may persist after patches. It integrates static vulnerability rules, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to uncover anomalies often missed by symbolic or neural models alone. We evaluate HYDRA in an unsupervised setting on patched functions from three diverse real-world software projects: Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick. Our results show HYDRA predicts 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions from Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick respectively as containing latent risks, including both heuristic matches and cases without heuristic matches ($None$) that may lead to zero-day vulnerabilities. It outperforms baseline models that rely solely on regex-derived features or their combination with embeddings, uncovering truly risky code variants that largely align with known heuristic patterns. These results demonstrate HYDRA's capability to surface hidden, previously undetected risks, advancing software security validation and supporting proactive zero-day vulnerabilities discovery.",2025-11-09 04:35:36+00:00,2025-11-09 04:35:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06220v1
RAG-targeted Adversarial Attack on LLM-based Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework,"The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping communication and operational practices across industries, but it also broadens the attack surface and increases susceptibility to security breaches. Artificial Intelligence has become a valuable solution in securing IoT networks, with Large Language Models (LLMs) enabling automated attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Despite advancements, the use of LLMs in such systems further expands the attack surface, putting entire networks at risk by introducing vulnerabilities such as prompt injection and data poisoning. In this work, we attack an LLM-based IoT attack analysis and mitigation framework to test its adversarial robustness. We construct an attack description dataset and use it in a targeted data poisoning attack that applies word-level, meaning-preserving perturbations to corrupt the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base of the framework. We then compare pre-attack and post-attack mitigation responses from the target model, ChatGPT-5 Thinking, to measure the impact of the attack on model performance, using an established evaluation rubric designed for human experts and judge LLMs. Our results show that small perturbations degrade LLM performance by weakening the linkage between observed network traffic features and attack behavior, and by reducing the specificity and practicality of recommended mitigations for resource-constrained devices.",2025-11-09 03:50:17+00:00,2025-11-09 03:50:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06212v1
Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting,"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.",2025-11-09 02:56:54+00:00,2025-11-09 02:56:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06197v1

CatBack: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Tabular Data via Categorical Encoding,"Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.   We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.",2025-11-08 17:02:42+00:00,2025-11-08 17:02:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06072v1
Cryptographic Binding Should Not Be Optional: A Formal-Methods Analysis of FIDO UAF Channel Binding,"As a case study in cryptographic binding, we present a formal-methods analysis of the cryptographic channel binding mechanisms in the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) authentication protocol, which seeks to reduce the use of traditional passwords in favor of authentication devices. First, we show that UAF's channel bindings fail to mitigate protocol interaction by a Dolev-Yao adversary, enabling the adversary to transfer the server's authentication challenge to alternate sessions of the protocol. As a result, in some contexts, the adversary can masquerade as a client and establish an authenticated session with a server (e.g., possibly a bank server). Second, we implement a proof-of-concept man-in-the-middle attack against eBay's open source FIDO UAF implementation. Third, we propose and formally verify improvements to UAF. The weakness we analyze is similar to the vulnerability discovered in the Needham-Schroeder protocol over 25 years ago. That this vulnerability appears in the FIDO UAF standard highlights the strong need for protocol designers to bind messages properly and to analyze their designs with formal-methods tools. To our knowledge, we are first to carry out a formal-methods analysis of channel binding in UAF and first to exhibit details of an attack on UAF that exploits the weaknesses of UAF's channel binding. Our case study illustrates the importance of cryptographically binding context to protocol messages to prevent an adversary from misusing messages out of context.",2025-11-08 14:50:52+00:00,2025-11-08 14:50:52+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06028v1
Injecting Falsehoods: Adversarial Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Undermining Factual Recall in LLMs,"LLMs are now an integral part of information retrieval. As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to ""victim"" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.",2025-11-20 10:04:04+00:00,2025-11-08 08:30:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05919v2
MCP-RiskCue: Can LLM Infer Risk Information From MCP Server System Logs?,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in solving complex tasks when integrated with external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models,"Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.",2025-11-25 17:27:33+00:00,2025-11-08 05:38:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865v2
Securing UAV Communications by Fusing Cross-Layer Fingerprints,"The open nature of wireless communications renders unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications vulnerable to impersonation attacks, under which malicious UAVs can impersonate authorized ones with stolen digital certificates. Traditional fingerprint-based UAV authentication approaches rely on a single modality of sensory data gathered from a single layer of the network model, resulting in unreliable authentication experiences, particularly when UAVs are mobile and in an open-world environment. To transcend these limitations, this paper proposes SecureLink, a UAV authentication system that is among the first to employ cross-layer information for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of UAV authentication. Instead of using single modalities, SecureLink fuses physical-layer radio frequency (RF) fingerprints and application-layer micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fingerprints into reliable UAV identifiers via multimodal fusion. SecureLink first aligns fingerprints from channel state information measurements and telemetry data, such as feedback readings of onboard accelerometers, gyroscopes, and barometers. Then, an attention-based neural network is devised for in-depth feature fusion. Next, the fused features are trained by a multi-similarity loss and fed into a one-class support vector machine for open-world authentication. We extensively implement our SecureLink using three different types of UAVs and evaluate it in different environments. With only six additional data frames, SecureLink achieves a closed-world accuracy of 98.61% and an open-world accuracy of 97.54% with two impersonating UAVs, outperforming the existing approaches in authentication robustness and communication overheads. Finally, our datasets collected from these experiments are available on GitHub: https://github.com/PhyGroup/SecureLink\_data.",2025-11-08 02:00:31+00:00,2025-11-08 02:00:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05796v1

BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services,"With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.",2025-11-07 12:25:39+00:00,2025-11-07 12:25:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1
A Secured Intent-Based Networking (sIBN) with Data-Driven Time-Aware Intrusion Detection,"While Intent-Based Networking (IBN) promises operational efficiency through autonomous and abstraction-driven network management, a critical unaddressed issue lies in IBN's implicit trust in the integrity of intent ingested by the network. This inherent assumption of data reliability creates a blind spot exploitable by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an adversary intercepts and alters intent before it is enacted, compelling the network to orchestrate malicious configurations. This study proposes a secured IBN (sIBN) system with data driven intrusion detection method designed to secure legitimate user intent from adversarial tampering. The proposed intent intrusion detection system uses a ML model applied for network behavioral anomaly detection to reveal temporal patterns of intent tampering. This is achieved by leveraging a set of original behavioral metrics and newly engineered time-aware features, with the model's hyperparameters fine-tuned through the randomized search cross-validation (RSCV) technique. Numerical results based on real-world data sets, show the effectiveness of sIBN, achieving the best performance across standard evaluation metrics, in both binary and multi classification tasks, while maintaining low error rates.",2025-11-07 10:28:01+00:00,2025-11-07 10:28:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05133v1
Cybersecurity AI in OT: Insights from an AI Top-10 Ranker in the Dragos OT CTF 2025,"Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity increasingly relies on rapid response across malware analysis, network forensics, and reverse engineering disciplines.

Key results include that storage I/O can degrade the performance of ASICs by as much as 357$\times$ and reduce GPUs performance by up to 22$\times$.",2025-11-07 03:09:59+00:00,2025-11-07 03:09:59+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04946v1
Zero Trust Security Model Implementation in Microservices Architectures Using Identity Federation,"The microservice bombshells that have been linked with the microservice expansion have altered the application architectures, offered agility and scalability in terms of complexity in security trade-offs. Feeble legacy-based perimeter-based policies are unable to offer safeguard to distributed workloads and temporary interaction among and in between the services. The article itself is a case on the need of the Zero Trust Security Model of micro services ecosystem, particularly, the fact that human and workloads require identity federation. It is proposed that the solution framework will be based on industry-standard authentication and authorization and end-to-end trust identity technologies, including Authorization and OpenID connect (OIDC), Authorization and OAuth 2.0 token exchange, and Authorization and SPIFFE/ SPIRE workload identities. Experimental evaluation is a unique demonstration of a superior security position of making use of a smaller attack surface, harmony policy enforcement, as well as interoperability across multi- domain environments. The research results overlay that the federated identity combined with the Zero Trust basics not only guarantee the rules relating to authentication and authorization but also fully complies with the latest DevSecOps standards of microservice deployment, which is automated, scaled, and resilient. The current project offers a stringent roadmap to the organizations that desire to apply Zero Trust in cloud-native technologies but will as well guarantee adherence and interoperability.",2025-11-07 02:03:05+00:00,2025-11-07 02:03:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04925v1
Bit-Flipping Attack Exploration and Countermeasure in 5G Network,"5G communication technology has become a vital component in a wide range of applications due to its unique advantages such as high data rate and low latency. While much of the existing research has focused on optimizing its efficiency and performance, security considerations have not received comparable attention, potentially leaving critical vulnerabilities unexplored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of 5G systems to bit-flipping attacks, which is an integrity attack where an adversary intercepts 5G network traffic and modifies specific fields of an encrypted message without decryption, thus mutating the message while remaining valid to the receiver. Notably, these attacks do not require the attacker to know the plaintext, and only the semantic meaning or position of certain fields would be enough to effect targeted modifications. We conduct our analysis on OpenAirInterface (OAI), an open-source 5G platform that follows the 3GPP Technical Specifications, to rigorously test the real-world feasibility and impact of bit-flipping attacks under current 5G encryption mechanisms. Finally, we propose a keystream-based shuffling defense mechanism to mitigate the effect of such attacks by raising the difficulty of manipulating specific encrypted fields, while introducing no additional communication overhead compared to the NAS Integrity Algorithm (NIA) in 5G. Our findings reveal that enhancements to 5G security are needed to better protect against attacks that alter data during transmission at the network level.",2025-11-06 23:51:28+00:00,2025-11-06 23:51:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04882v1

Security Evaluation of Quantum Circuit Split Compilation under an Oracle-Guided Attack,"Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are systematically tested against input-output observations, with iteratively pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new protection schemes.",2025-11-06 22:06:51+00:00,2025-11-06 22:06:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04842v1
Trustworthiness Calibration Framework for Phishing Email Detection Using Large Language Models,"Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification, their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario, using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in LLM-based phishing detection.",2025-11-06 18:14:44+00:00,2025-11-06 18:14:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04728v1
Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments,"The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.",2025-11-06 17:03:33+00:00,2025-11-06 17:03:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550v1
Large Language Models for Cyber Security,"This paper studies the integration off Large Language Models into cybersecurity tools and protocols. The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.",2025-11-06 16:25:35+00:00,2025-11-06 16:25:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04508v1
Adversarially Robust and Interpretable Magecart Malware Detection,"Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied, further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to distinguish between benign and malicious scripts. Such models are supported by a Behavior Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) which captures structural behavior patterns in scripts, helping to analyze and classify client-side script execution logs. To ensure robustness against adversarial evasion attacks, the ML models were adversarially trained and evaluated using attacks from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox and the Adaptative Perturbation Pattern Method. In addition, concise explanations of ML model decisions are provided, supporting transparency and user trust. Experimental validation demonstrated high detection performance and interpretable reasoning, demonstrating that traditional ML models can be effective in real-world web security contexts.",2025-11-06 15:13:29+00:00,2025-11-06 15:13:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04440v1
A Parallel Region-Adaptive Differential Privacy Framework for Image Pixelization,"The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability, and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity, leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.",2025-11-06 10:51:20+00:00,2025-11-06 10:51:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04261v1
Black-Box Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.",2025-11-06 09:24:49+00:00,2025-11-06 09:24:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04215v1

Design and Detection of Covert Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks on Water Treatment Plants,"Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness, underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial control environments.",2025-11-06 01:49:38+00:00,2025-11-06 01:49:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03971v1
Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion,"Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code, but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

Security Analysis of Agentic AI Communication Protocols: A Comparative Evaluation,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly foundational to complex, distributed workflows. Yet, the security of their underlying communication protocols remains critically under-examined. This paper presents the first empirical, comparative security analysis of the official CORAL implementation and a high-fidelity, SDK-based ACP implementation, benchmarked against a literature-based evaluation of A2A. Using a 14 point vulnerability taxonomy, we systematically assess their defenses across authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Our results reveal a pronounced security dichotomy: CORAL exhibits a robust architectural design, particularly in its transport-layer message validation and session isolation, but suffers from critical implementation-level vulnerabilities, including authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway. Conversely, ACP's architectural flexibility, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into high-impact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these findings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing protocols remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines CORAL's integrated architecture with ACP's mandatory per-message integrity guarantees, laying the groundwork for resilient, next-generation agent communications.",2025-11-05 20:19:22+00:00,2025-11-05 20:19:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03841v1
Temporal Analysis Framework for Intrusion Detection Systems: A Novel Taxonomy for Time-Aware Cybersecurity,"Most intrusion detection systems still identify attacks only after significant damage has occurred, detecting late-stage tactics rather than early indicators of compromise. This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework and taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic review of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS methods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to multi-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow sequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal coverage across MITRE ATT&CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance through Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely used datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress toward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for developing IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber threats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms.",2025-11-05 19:03:40+00:00,2025-11-05 19:03:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03799v1
Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like ""money laundering"" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.",2025-11-05 17:47:46+00:00,2025-11-05 17:47:46+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675v1
Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles,"The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the information coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times, philosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure the reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which pertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic machines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles and the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this problem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles has added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains. This paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles, developing a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy, lexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the relationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented framework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and computational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each field. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing strategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights from Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can also be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",2025-11-05 09:32:01+00:00,2025-11-05 09:32:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03319v1
Let the Bees Find the Weak Spots: A Path Planning Perspective on Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks against LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.",2025-11-05 08:05:58+00:00,2025-11-05 08:05:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03271v1
Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic,"Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.",2025-11-05 06:36:16+00:00,2025-11-05 06:36:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1
Jailbreaking in the Haystack,"Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.",2025-11-05 01:12:50+00:00,2025-11-05 01:12:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04707v1
Exploratory Analysis of Cyberattack Patterns on E-Commerce Platforms Using Statistical Methods,"Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms have grown in sophistication, threatening consumer trust and operational continuity. This research presents a hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247). The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type classification. Ethical considerations, including responsible use of sensitive data and bias assessment, were incorporated. Despite class imbalance and reliance on historical data, the study provides insights for proactive cybersecurity resource allocation and outlines directions for future real-time threat detection research.",2025-11-04 21:38:59+00:00,2025-11-04 21:38:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03020v1
PrivyWave: Privacy-Aware Wireless Sensing of Heartbeat,"Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar, unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations (120° field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in pervasive health monitoring.",2025-11-06 02:34:25+00:00,2025-11-04 20:54:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02993v2
Lightweight Session-Key Rekeying Framework for Secure IoT-Edge Communication,"The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands security mechanisms that protect constrained devices without the computational cost of public-key cryptography. Conventional Pre-Shared Key (PSK) encryption, while efficient, remains vulnerable due to static key reuse, replay attacks, and the lack of forward secrecy. This paper presents the Dynamic Session Enhanced Key Protocol (DSEKP) - a lightweight session-key rekeying framework, a fully symmetric extension to PSK that derives per-session AES-GCM keys using the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF-SHA256) and authenticates session establishment through an HMAC proof in a single init-ack exchange. DSEKP was implemented on an ESP32 IoT sensor node and a Raspberry Pi 5 edge server communicating through a Mosquitto MQTT broker, and benchmarked against a static PSK baseline over more than 6,500 encrypted packets per configuration. The results demonstrate nearly identical throughput and reliability, with moderate overhead - mean latency increased by 27% and payload size by 10% - while delivering per-session forward secrecy and built-in replay protection. These findings confirm that dynamic symmetric rekeying can substantially strengthen IoT-Edge links with minimal computational and bandwidth cost, offering a practical migration path from static PSK to session-aware, scalable, and reproducible IoT security.",2025-11-04 19:12:18+00:00,2025-11-04 19:12:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02924v1
PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.",2025-11-06 12:47:29+00:00,2025-11-04 18:03:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v2
Adaptive and Robust Data Poisoning Detection and Sanitization in Wearable IoT Systems using Large Language Models,"The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting, whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives. These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable IoT systems.",2025-11-21 15:30:31+00:00,2025-11-04 15:59:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02894v3
Verifying LLM Inference to Prevent Model Weight Exfiltration,"As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and, more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.",2025-11-04 14:51:44+00:00,2025-11-04 14:51:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02620v1
AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.",2025-11-09 05:14:14+00:00,2025-11-04 08:56:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376v2

Private Map-Secure Reduce: Infrastructure for Efficient AI Data Markets,"The modern AI data economy centralizes power, limits innovation, and misallocates value by extracting data without control, privacy, or fair compensation. We introduce Private Map-Secure Reduce (PMSR), a network-native paradigm that transforms data economics from extractive to participatory through cryptographically enforced markets. Extending MapReduce to decentralized settings, PMSR enables computation to move to the data, ensuring verifiable privacy, efficient price discovery, and incentive alignment. Demonstrations include large-scale recommender audits, privacy-preserving LLM ensembling (87.5\% MMLU accuracy across six models), and distributed analytics over hundreds of nodes. PMSR establishes a scalable, equitable, and privacy-guaranteed foundation for the next generation of AI data markets.",2025-11-03 20:39:25+00:00,2025-11-03 20:39:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02055v1
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Rare Event Prediction,"Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2) quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical methods.",2025-11-03 20:24:55+00:00,2025-11-03 20:24:55+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02042v1
Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons(PoSN): Neuromorphic Consensus for Next-Generation Blockchains,"Blockchain systems face persistent challenges of scalability, latency, and energy inefficiency. Existing consensus protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) either consume excessive resources or risk centralization. This paper proposes \textit{Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons (PoSN)}, a neuromorphic consensus protocol inspired by spiking neural networks. PoSN encodes transactions as spike trains, elects leaders through competitive firing dynamics, and finalizes blocks via neural synchronization, enabling parallel and event-driven consensus with minimal energy overhead. A hybrid system architecture is implemented on neuromorphic platforms, supported by simulation frameworks such as Nengo and PyNN. Experimental results show significant gains in energy efficiency, throughput, and convergence compared to PoB and PoR. PoSN establishes a foundation for sustainable, adaptive blockchains suitable for IoT, edge, and large-scale distributed systems.",2025-11-03 19:31:47+00:00,2025-11-03 19:31:47+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02868v1
AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents,"AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.   AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy formalization: a novel cross-LLM voting mechanism to guarantee confidence of the parsed privacy policy model. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates data practices based on the AI agent's context and the privacy policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology graphs and automata-based checking connect the privacy policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checking. (iv) User interface: an infrastructure-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy policy violations, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.   We evaluate AudAgent with AI agents built using mainstream frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and visualizing privacy policy violations in real time. Using AudAgent, we also find that most privacy policies omit explicit safeguards for highly sensitive data such as SSNs, whose misuse violates legal requirements, and that many agents do not refuse handling such data via third-party tools, including those controlled by Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AudAgent proactively blocks operations on such data, overriding the agents' original privacy policy and behavior.",2025-11-20 21:03:58+00:00,2025-11-03 17:32:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441v2

Prompt Injection as an Emerging Threat: Evaluating the Resilience of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in intelligent systems that perform reasoning, summarization, and code generation. Their ability to follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4 %), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and reliability.",2025-11-11 21:55:25+00:00,2025-11-03 14:43:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01634v2
Evaluation of compliance with democratic and technical standards of i-voting in elections to academic senates in Czech higher education,"The shift towards increased remote work and digital communication, driven by recent global developments, has led to the widespread adoption of i-voting systems, including in academic institutions. This paper critically evaluates the use of i-voting platforms for elections to academic senates at Czech public universities, focusing on the democratic and technical challenges they present. A total of 18 out of 26 Czech public universities have implemented remote electronic voting for these elections. Yet, the systems often lack the necessary transparency, raising significant concerns regarding their adherence to democratic norms, such as election security, voter privacy, and the integrity of the process. Through interviews with system developers and administrators, along with a survey of potential voters, the study underscores the critical need for transparency. Without it, a comprehensive assessment of the technical standards and the overall legitimacy of the i-voting systems remains unattainable, potentially undermining the credibility of the electoral outcomes.",2025-11-03 14:00:47+00:00,2025-11-03 14:00:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01598v1
Federated Cyber Defense: Privacy-Preserving Ransomware Detection Across Distributed Systems,"Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing, and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI) detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing. Compounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that are both robust and adaptable.   In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a ransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This paradigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both software and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall systems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be transferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or regulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we validate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP) dataset.   Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by a relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to centralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable, high-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware detection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.",2025-11-03 13:54:13+00:00,2025-11-03 13:54:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01583v1
Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for LVLMs via Prior Knowledge-Calibrated Memory Probing,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on vast corpora of visual and textual data. Empowered by large-scale parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/spmede/KCMP.",2025-11-03 13:16:30+00:00,2025-11-03 13:16:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01952v1
"Security-Aware Joint Sensing, Communication, and Computing Optimization in Low Altitude Wireless Networks","As terrestrial resources become increasingly saturated, the research attention is shifting to the low-altitude airspace, with many emerging applications such as urban air taxis and aerial inspection. Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNs) are the foundation for these applications, with integrated sensing, communications, and computing (ISCC) being one of the core parts of LAWNs. However, the openness of low-altitude airspace exposes communications to security threats, degrading ISCC performance and ultimately compromising the reliability of applications supported by LAWNs. To address these challenges, this paper studies joint performance optimization of ISCC while considering secrecyness of the communications. Specifically, we derive beampattern error, secrecy rate, and age of information (AoI) as performance metrics for sensing, secrecy communication, and computing. Building on these metrics, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances sensing and computation performance while keeping the probability of communication being detected below a required threshold. We then propose a deep Q-network (DQN)-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which adaptively selects evolutionary operators according to the evolving optimization objectives, thereby leading to more effective solutions. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method achieves a superior balance among sensing accuracy, communication secrecyness, and information freshness compared with baseline algorithms, thereby safeguarding ISCC performance and LAWN-supported low-altitude applications.",2025-11-03 11:06:41+00:00,2025-11-03 11:06:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01451v1
Beyond Static Thresholds: Adaptive RRC Signaling Storm Detection with Extreme Value Theory,"In 5G and beyond networks, the radio communication between a User Equipment (UE) and a base station (gNodeB or gNB), also known as the air interface, is a critical component of network access and connectivity. During the connection establishment procedure, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer can be vulnerable to signaling storms, which threaten the availability of the radio access control plane. These attacks may occur when one or more UEs send a large number of connection requests to the gNB, preventing new UEs from establishing connections. In this paper, we investigate the detection of such threats and propose an adaptive threshold-based detection system based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The proposed solution is evaluated numerically by applying simulated attack scenarios based on a realistic threat model on top of real-world RRC traffic data from an operator network. We show that, by leveraging features from the RRC layer only, the detection system can not only identify the attacks but also differentiate them from legitimate high-traffic situations. The adaptive threshold calculated using EVT ensures that the system can work under diverse traffic conditions. The results show high accuracy, precision, and recall values (above 93%), and a low detection latency even under complex conditions.",2025-11-03 09:42:12+00:00,2025-11-03 09:42:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01391v1
Black-Box Differentially Private Nonparametric Confidence Intervals Under Minimal Assumptions,"We introduce a simple, general framework that takes any differentially private estimator of any arbitrary quantity as a black box, and from it constructs a differentially private nonparametric confidence interval of that quantity. Our approach repeatedly subsamples the data, applies the private estimator to each subsample, and then post-processes the resulting empirical CDF to a confidence interval. Our analysis uses the randomness from the subsampling to achieve privacy amplification. Under mild assumptions, the empirical CDF we obtain approaches the CDF of the private statistic as the sample size grows. We use this to show that the confidence intervals we estimate are asymptotically valid, tight, and equivalent to their non-private counterparts. We provide empirical evidence that our method performs well compared with the (less-general) state-of-the-art algorithms.",2025-11-03 07:38:30+00:00,2025-11-03 07:38:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01303v1
Verification and Attack Synthesis for Network Protocols,"Network protocols are programs with inputs and outputs that follow predefined communication patterns to synchronize and exchange information. There are many protocols and each serves a different purpose, e.g., routing, transport, secure communication, etc. The functional and performance requirements for a protocol can be expressed using a formal specification, such as, a set of logical predicates over its traces. A protocol could be prevented from achieving its requirements due to a bug in its design or implementation, a component failure (e.g., a crash), or an attack. This dissertation shows that formal methods can feasibly characterize the functionality and performance of network protocols under normal conditions as well as when subjected to attacks.",2025-11-03 00:26:12+00:00,2025-11-03 00:26:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01124v1
Leakage-abuse Attack Against Substring-SSE with Partially Known Dataset,"Substring-searchable symmetric encryption (substring-SSE) has become increasingly critical for privacy-preserving applications in cloud systems. However, existing schemes remain vulnerable to information leakage during search operations, particularly when adversaries possess partial knowledge of the target dataset. Although leakage-abuse attacks have been widely studied for traditional SSE, their applicability to substring-SSE under partially known data assumptions remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first leakage-abuse attack on substring-SSE under partially-known dataset conditions. We develop a novel matrix-based correlation technique that extends and optimizes the LEAP framework for substring-SSE, enabling efficient recovery of plaintext data from encrypted suffix tree structures. Unlike existing approaches that rely on independent auxiliary datasets, our method directly exploits known data fragments to establish high-confidence mappings between ciphertext tokens and plaintext substrings through iterative matrix transformations. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, with recovery rates reaching 98.32% for substrings given 50% auxiliary knowledge. Even with only 10% prior knowledge, the attack achieves 74.42% substring recovery while maintaining strong scalability across datasets of varying sizes. The result reveals significant privacy risks in current substring-SSE designs and highlights the urgent need for leakage-resilient constructions.",2025-11-02 13:12:19+00:00,2025-11-02 13:12:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00930v1

EP-HDC: Hyperdimensional Computing with Encrypted Parameters for High-Throughput Privacy-Preserving Inference,"While homomorphic encryption (HE) provides strong privacy protection, its high computational cost has restricted its application to simple tasks. Recently, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) applied to HE has shown promising performance for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). However, when applied to more realistic scenarios such as batch inference, the HDC-based HE has still very high compute time as well as high encryption and data transmission overheads. To address this problem, we propose HDC with encrypted parameters (EP-HDC), which is a novel PPML approach featuring client-side HE, i.e., inference is performed on a client using a homomorphically encrypted model. Our EP-HDC can effectively mitigate the encryption and data transmission overhead, as well as providing high scalability with many clients while providing strong protection for user data and model parameters. In addition to application examples for our client-side PPML, we also present design space exploration involving quantization, architecture, and HE-related parameters. Our experimental results using the BFV scheme and the Face/Emotion datasets demonstrate that our method can improve throughput and latency of batch inference by orders of magnitude over previous PPML methods (36.52~1068x and 6.45~733x, respectively) with less than 1% accuracy degradation.",2025-11-01 23:22:01+00:00,2025-11-01 23:22:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00737v1
An Efficient Anomaly Detection Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Markov Process,"Wireless Sensor Networks forms the backbone of modern cyber physical systems used in various applications such as environmental monitoring, healthcare monitoring, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure. Ensuring the reliability of data collected through these networks is essential as these data may contain anomalies due to many reasons such as sensor faults, environmental disturbances, or malicious intrusions. In this paper a lightweight and interpretable anomaly detection framework based on a first order Markov chain model has been proposed. The method discretizes continuous sensor readings into finite states and models the temporal dynamics of sensor transitions through a transition probability matrix. Anomalies are detected when observed transitions occur with probabilities below a computed threshold, allowing for real time detection without labeled data or intensive computation. The proposed framework was validated using the Intel Berkeley Research Lab dataset, as a case study on indoor environmental monitoring demonstrates its capability to identify thermal spikes, voltage related faults, and irregular temperature fluctuations with high precision. Comparative analysis with Z score, Hidden Markov Model, and Auto encoder based methods shows that the proposed Markov based framework achieves a balanced trade-off between accuracy, F1 score is 0.86, interoperability, and computational efficiency. The systems scalability and low resource footprint highlight its suitability for large-scale and real time anomaly detection in WSN deployments.",2025-11-01 10:19:00+00:00,2025-11-01 10:19:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00481v1
Proactive DDoS Detection and Mitigation in Decentralized Software-Defined Networking via Port-Level Monitoring and Zero-Training Large Language Models,"Centralized Software-Defined Networking (cSDN) offers flexible and programmable control of networks but suffers from scalability and reliability issues due to its reliance on centralized controllers. Decentralized SDN (dSDN) alleviates these concerns by distributing control across multiple local controllers, yet this architecture remains highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and mitigation framework tailored for dSDN environments. The framework leverages lightweight port-level statistics combined with prompt engineering and in-context learning, enabling the DeepSeek-v3 Large Language Model (LLM) to classify traffic as benign or malicious without requiring fine-tuning or retraining. Once an anomaly is detected, mitigation is enforced directly at the attacker's port, ensuring that malicious traffic is blocked at their origin while normal traffic remains unaffected. An automatic recovery mechanism restores normal operation after the attack inactivity, ensuring both security and availability. Experimental evaluation under diverse DDoS attack scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves near-perfect detection, with 99.99% accuracy, 99.97% precision, 100% recall, 99.98% F1-score, and an AUC of 1.0. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining distributed monitoring with zero-training LLM inference, providing a proactive and scalable defense mechanism for securing dSDN infrastructures against DDoS threats.",2025-11-01 08:57:29+00:00,2025-11-01 08:57:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00460v1
ToxicTextCLIP: Text-Based Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on CLIP Pre-training,"The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

Zero-Knowledge Extensions on Solana: A Theory of ZK Architecture,"This paper reconstructs zero-knowledge extensions on Solana as an architecture theory. Drawing on the existing ecosystem and on the author's prior papers and implementations as reference material, we propose a two-axis model that normalizes zero-knowledge (ZK) use by purpose (scalability vs. privacy) and by placement (on-chain vs. off-chain). On this grid we define five layer-crossing invariants: origin authenticity, replay-safety, finality alignment, parameter binding, and private consumption, which serve as a common vocabulary for reasoning about correctness across modules and chains. The framework covers the Solana Foundation's three pillars (ZK Compression, Confidential Transfer, light clients/bridges) together with surrounding components (Light Protocol/Helius, Succinct SP1, RISC Zero, Wormhole, Tinydancer, Arcium). From the theory we derive two design abstractions - Proof-Carrying Message (PCM) and a Verifier Router Interface - and a cross-chain counterpart, Proof-Carrying Interchain Message (PCIM), indicating concrete avenues for extending the three pillars.",2025-11-01 05:58:13+00:00,2025-11-01 05:58:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00415v1
Penetrating the Hostile: Detecting DeFi Protocol Exploits through Cross-Contract Analysis,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are crypto projects developed on the blockchain to manage digital assets. Attacks on DeFi have been frequent and have resulted in losses exceeding $80 billion. Current tools detect and locate possible vulnerabilities in contracts by analyzing the state changes that may occur during malicious events. However, this victim-only approaches seldom possess the capability to cover the attacker's interaction intention logic. Furthermore, only a minuscule percentage of DeFi protocols experience attacks in real-world scenarios, which poses a significant challenge for these detection tools to demonstrate practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose DeFiTail, the first framework that utilizes deep learning technology for access control and flash loan exploit detection. Through feeding the cross-contract static data flow, DeFiTail automatically learns the attack logic in real-world malicious events that occur on DeFi protocols, capturing the threat patterns between attacker and victim contracts. Since the DeFi protocol events involve interactions with multi-account transactions, the execution path with external and internal transactions requires to be unified. Moreover, to mitigate the impact of mistakes in Control Flow Graph (CFG) connections, DeFiTail validates the data path by employing the symbolic execution stack. Furthermore, we feed the data paths through our model to achieve the inspection of DeFi protocols. Comparative experiment results indicate that DeFiTail achieves the highest accuracy, with 98.39% in access control and 97.43% in flash loan exploits. DeFiTail also demonstrates an enhanced capability to detect malicious contracts, identifying 86.67% accuracy from the CVE dataset.",2025-11-01 05:23:24+00:00,2025-11-01 05:23:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00408v1

Evaluated via dual validation (TR-TS/TS-TR), seven classifiers, and utility metrics, MalDataGen outperforms benchmarks like SDV while preserving data utility. Its flexible design enables seamless integration into detection pipelines, offering a practical solution for cybersecurity applications.",2025-11-01 02:08:58+00:00,2025-11-01 02:08:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00361v1
Mind the Gap: Missing Cyber Threat Coverage in NIDS Datasets for the Energy Sector,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) developed using publicly available datasets predominantly focus on enterprise environments, raising concerns about their effectiveness for converged Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) in energy infrastructures. This study evaluates the representativeness of five widely used datasets: CIC-IDS2017, SWaT, WADI, Sherlock, and CIC-Modbus2023 against network-detectable MITRE ATT&CK techniques extracted from documented energy sector incidents. Using a structured five-step analytical approach, this article successfully developed and performed a gap analysis that identified 94 network observable techniques from an initial pool of 274 ATT&CK techniques. Sherlock dataset exhibited the highest mean coverage (0.56), followed closely by CIC-IDS2017 (0.55), while SWaT and WADI recorded the lowest scores (0.38). Combining CIC-IDS2017, Sherlock, and CIC-Modbus2023 achieved an aggregate coverage of 92%, highlighting their complementary strengths. The analysis identifies critical gaps, particularly in lateral movement and industrial protocol manipulation, providing a clear pathway for dataset enhancement and more robust NIDS evaluation in hybrid IT/OT energy environments.",2025-11-01 02:02:25+00:00,2025-11-01 02:02:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00360v1
Ultralow-power standoff acoustic leak detection,"An automated, standoff acoustic leak detection scheme has been designed, built, and tested. It merges the principles of glass breakage and smoke detection to alert for the presence of leaks emanating from pressurized plumbing. A simulated water leak flowing at 0.15 l/min has been reliably detected at a standoff distance of more than 10 m. The device is also effective at identifying the presence of leaks located behind surfaces such as walls, doors, floors, and ceilings. The anticipated application is as an autonomous, battery-powered, remote wireless node. All signal processing and analysis takes place on the edge with no need to stream audio data to the cloud. Sensor status is conveyed on-demand with only a few bytes of information, requiring minimal bandwidth. Power consumption is the range of 20--200 micro-Watts, depending on the amount of environmental noise and desired sensor latency. To attain optimum sensitivity and reliability, the hardware operates at acoustic frequencies well above the range of human conversations, making eavesdropping impossible. Development has been done with water escaping from pressurized plumbing, but the sensor concept can be used effectively to detect gas leaks.",2025-11-01 01:23:32+00:00,2025-11-01 01:23:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00348v1
Exploiting Latent Space Discontinuities for Building Universal LLM Jailbreaks and Data Extraction Attacks,"The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant concerns about their security against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to crafting universal jailbreaks and data extraction attacks by exploiting latent space discontinuities, an architectural vulnerability related to the sparsity of training data. Unlike previous methods, our technique generalizes across various models and interfaces, proving highly effective in seven state-of-the-art LLMs and one image generation model. Initial results indicate that when these discontinuities are exploited, they can consistently and profoundly compromise model behavior, even in the presence of layered defenses. The findings suggest that this strategy has substantial potential as a systemic attack vector.",2025-11-01 01:19:12+00:00,2025-11-01 01:19:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00346v1

Security Audit of intel ICE Driver for e810 Network Interface Card,"The security of enterprise-grade networking hardware and software is critical to ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data in modern cloud and data center environments. Network interface controllers (NICs) play a pivotal role in high-performance computing and virtualization, but their privileged access to system resources makes them a prime target for security vulnerabilities. This study presents a security analysis of the Intel ICE driver using the E810 Ethernet Controller, employing static analysis, fuzz testing, and timing-based side-channel evaluation to assess robustness against exploitation. The objective is to evaluate the drivers resilience to malformed inputs, identify implementation weaknesses, and determine whether timing discrepancies can be exploited for unauthorized inference of system states. Static code analysis reveals that insufficient bounds checking and unsafe string operations may introduce security flaws. Fuzz testing targets the Admin Queue, debugfs interface, and virtual function (VF) management. Interface-aware fuzzing and command mutation confirm strong input validation that prevents memory corruption and privilege escalation under normal conditions. However, using principles from KernelSnitch, the driver is found to be susceptible to timing-based side-channel attacks. Execution time discrepancies in hash table lookups allow an unprivileged attacker to infer VF occupancy states, enabling potential network mapping in multi-tenant environments. Further analysis shows inefficiencies in Read-Copy-Update (RCU) synchronization, where missing synchronization leads to stale data persistence, memory leaks, and out-of-memory conditions. Kernel instrumentation confirms that occupied VF lookups complete faster than unoccupied queries, exposing timing-based information leakage.",2025-11-05 15:15:41+00:00,2025-10-31 20:20:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01910v2
Identifying Linux Kernel Instability Due to Poor RCU Synchronization,"Read-Copy-Update (RCU) is widely used in the Linux kernel to manage concurrent access to shared data structures.However, improper synchronization when removing RCU protected hash table entries can lead to stale pointers, inconsistent lookups, and critical use after free (UAF) vulnerabilities. This paper investigates a driver-level synchronization issue arising from the omission of explicit synchronize_rcu() calls during hash table updates, using a discovered weakness in the Intel ICE network drivers Virtual Function (VF) management. Previous kernel vulnerabilities, such as a bug in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) subsystem, show how improper RCU synchronization can directly cause kernel crashes. Experimental results demonstrate that removing VF entries without proper synchronization leaves transient stale entries, delays memory reclamation, and results in significant memory fragmentation under rapid insert/delete workloads. RCU hash tables are widely deployed in Linux kernel subsystems such as networking, virtualization, and file systems; improper synchronization can cause memory fragmentation, kernel instability, and out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. Mitigations are proposed, recommending explicit insertion of synchronize_rcu() calls to ensure timely and safe memory reclamation. These findings reinforce established best practices for RCU synchronization, highlighting their importance for maintaining kernel stability and memory safety.

Best Practices for Biorisk Evaluations on Open-Weight Bio-Foundation Models,"Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose BioRiskEval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. BioRiskEval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.",2025-11-20 18:33:49+00:00,2025-10-31 17:00:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27629v4
Sybil-Resistant Service Discovery for Agent Economies,"x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.",2025-10-31 15:29:31+00:00,2025-10-31 15:29:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27554v1
Binary Anomaly Detection in Streaming IoT Traffic under Concept Drift,"With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.",2025-10-31 09:21:28+00:00,2025-10-31 09:21:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27304v1
Sustaining Cyber Awareness: The Long-Term Impact of Continuous Phishing Training and Emotional Triggers,"Phishing constitutes more than 90\% of successful cyberattacks globally, remaining one of the most persistent threats to organizational security. Despite organizations tripling their cybersecurity budgets between 2015 and 2025, the human factor continues to pose a critical vulnerability. This study presents a 12-month longitudinal investigation examining how continuous cybersecurity training and emotional cues affect employee susceptibility to phishing. The experiment involved 20 organizations and over 1,300 employees who collectively received more than 13,000 simulated phishing emails engineered with diverse emotional, contextual, and structural characteristics. Behavioral responses were analyzed using non-parametric correlation and regression models to assess the influence of psychological manipulation, message personalization, and perceived email source. Results demonstrate that sustained phishing simulations and targeted training programs lead to a significant reduction in employee susceptibility, halving successful compromise rates within six months. Additionally, employee turnover introduces measurable fluctuations in awareness levels, underscoring the necessity of maintaining continuous training initiatives. These findings provide one of the few long-term perspectives on phishing awareness efficacy, highlighting the strategic importance of ongoing behavioral interventions in strengthening organizational cyber resilience.

Real-time and Zero-footprint Bag of Synthetic Syllables Algorithm for E-mail Spam Detection Using Subject Line and Short Text Fields,"Contemporary e-mail services have high availability expectations from the customers and are resource-strained because of the high-volume throughput and spam attacks. Deep Machine Learning architectures, which are resource hungry and require off-line processing due to the long processing times, are not acceptable at the front line filters. On the other hand, the bulk of the incoming spam is not sophisticated enough to bypass even the simplest algorithms. While the small fraction of the intelligent, highly mutable spam can be detected only by the deep architectures, the stress on them can be unloaded by the simple near real-time and near zero-footprint algorithms such as the Bag of Synthetic Syllables algorithm applied to the short texts of the e-mail subject lines and other short text fields. The proposed algorithm creates a circa 200 sparse dimensional hash or vector for each e-mail subject line that can be compared for the cosine or euclidean proximity distance to find similarities to the known spammy subjects. The algorithm does not require any persistent storage, dictionaries, additional hardware upgrades or software packages. The performance of the algorithm is presented on the one day of the real SMTP traffic.",2025-10-31 05:10:38+00:00,2025-10-31 05:10:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00118v1
Descriptor-Based Object-Aware Memory Systems: A Comprehensive Review,"The security and efficiency of modern computing systems are fundamentally undermined by the absence of a native architectural mechanism to propagate high-level program semantics, such as object identity, bounds, and lifetime, across the hardware/software interface. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the architectural paradigm designed to bridge this semantic gap: descriptor-based, object-aware memory systems. By elevating the descriptor to a first-class architectural abstraction, this paradigm enables hardware to dynamically acquire and enforce the rich semantics of software-defined objects. This survey systematically charts the evolution and current landscape of this approach. We establish the foundational concepts of memory objects and descriptors and introduce a novel taxonomy of descriptor addressing modes, providing a structured framework for analyzing and comparing diverse implementations. Our unified analysis reveals how this paradigm holistically addresses the intertwined challenges of memory protection, management, and processing. As a culminating case study, we re-examine the CentroID model, demonstrating how its hybrid tagged-pointer encoding and descriptor processing mechanisms embody the path toward practical and efficient object-aware designs. Finally, we outline how the explicit cross-layer communication of object semantics provides a foundational research direction for next-generation cache hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and even 128-bit architectures.",2025-11-10 02:03:06+00:00,2025-10-31 00:39:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27070v2
LLM-based Multi-class Attack Analysis and Mitigation Framework in IoT/IIoT Networks,"The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and operations across industries but also increasing the attack surface and security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT, enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion. Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion. After benchmarking several ML and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to guide ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 in producing detailed, context-aware responses. We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative assessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon H1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the responses.

"Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability","We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",2025-10-30 17:59:09+00:00,2025-10-30 17:59:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792v1
Unvalidated Trust: Cross-Stage Vulnerabilities in Large Language Model Architectures,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated, multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs. The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce ""Countermind"" as a conceptual blueprint for implementing these defenses.",2025-10-30 09:38:45+00:00,2025-10-30 09:38:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27190v1
Who Grants the Agent Power? Defending Against Instruction Injection via Task-Centric Access Control,"AI agents capable of GUI understanding and Model Context Protocol are increasingly deployed to automate mobile tasks. However, their reliance on over-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability: instruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign content like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We present AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control framework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting broad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces minimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g., register for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that AgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an agent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate task to complete. Our approach highlights the urgent need for intent-aligned security models to safely govern the next generation of autonomous agents.",2025-10-30 07:36:59+00:00,2025-10-30 07:36:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26212v1
Who Moved My Transaction? Uncovering Post-Transaction Auditability Vulnerabilities in Modern Super Apps,"Super apps are the cornerstones of modern digital life, embedding financial transactions into nearly every aspect of daily routine. The prevailing security paradigm for these platforms is overwhelmingly focused on pre-transaction authentication, preventing unauthorized payments before they occur. We argue that a critical vulnerability vector has been largely overlooked: the fragility of post-transaction audit trails. We investigate the ease with which a user can permanently erase their transaction history from an app's interface, thereby concealing unauthorized or sensitive activities from the account owner. To quantify this threat, we conducted an empirical study with 6 volunteers who performed a cross-evaluation on six super apps. Our findings are alarming: all six applications studied allow users to delete transaction records, yet a staggering five out of six (83+\%) fail to protect these records with strong authentication. Only one app in our study required biometric verification for deletion. This study provides the first concrete evidence of this near-ubiquitous vulnerability, demonstrating a critical gap in the current mobile security landscape and underscoring the urgent need for a paradigm shift towards ensuring post-transaction audit integrity.",2025-10-30 07:34:20+00:00,2025-10-30 07:34:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26210v1
Confidential FRIT via Homomorphic Encryption,"Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers. However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied.

Security Vulnerabilities in AI-Generated Code: A Large-Scale Analysis of Public GitHub Repositories,"This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code across public GitHub repositories. We collected and analyzed 7,703 files explicitly attributed to four major AI tools: ChatGPT (91.52\%), GitHub Copilot (7.50\%), Amazon CodeWhisperer (0.52\%), and Tabnine (0.46\%). Using CodeQL static analysis, we identified 4,241 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances across 77 distinct vulnerability types. Our findings reveal that while 87.9\% of AI-generated code does not contain identifiable CWE-mapped vulnerabilities, significant patterns emerge regarding language-specific vulnerabilities and tool performance. Python consistently exhibited higher vulnerability rates (16.18\%-18.50\%) compared to JavaScript (8.66\%-8.99\%) and TypeScript (2.50\%-7.14\%) across all tools. We observed notable differences in security performance, with GitHub Copilot achieving better security density for Python (1,739 LOC per CWE) and TypeScript, while ChatGPT performed better for JavaScript. Additionally, we discovered widespread use of AI tools for documentation generation (39\% of collected files), an understudied application with implications for software maintainability. These findings extend previous work with a significantly larger dataset and provide valuable insights for developing language-specific and context-aware security practices for the responsible integration of AI-generated code into software development workflows.",2025-10-30 03:29:06+00:00,2025-10-30 03:29:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26103v1
PEEL: A Poisoning-Exposing Encoding Theoretical Framework for Local Differential Privacy,"Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a widely adopted privacy-protection model in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and scalable nature. However, it is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, and existing defenses either incur prohibitive resource overheads or rely on domain-specific prior knowledge, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PEEL, a Poisoning-Exposing Encoding theoretical framework for LDP, which departs from resource- or prior-dependent countermeasures and instead leverages the inherent structural consistency of LDP-perturbed data. As a non-intrusive post-processing module, PEEL amplifies stealthy poisoning effects by re-encoding LDP-perturbed data via sparsification, normalization, and low-rank projection, thereby revealing both output and rule poisoning attacks through structural inconsistencies in the reconstructed space. Theoretical analysis proves that PEEL, integrated with LDP, retains unbiasedness and statistical accuracy, while being robust to expose both output and rule poisoning attacks. Moreover, evaluation results show that LDP-integrated PEEL not only outperforms four state-of-the-art defenses in terms of poisoning exposure accuracy but also significantly reduces client-side computational costs, making it highly suitable for large-scale IoT deployments.",2025-10-30 03:29:02+00:00,2025-10-30 03:29:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26102v1
"SoK: Honeypots & LLMs, More Than the Sum of Their Parts?","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the long-standing paradox in honeypot design, achieving high-fidelity deception with low operational risk. Through a flurry of research since late 2022, steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation is exhibited. Since late 2022, a flurry of research has demonstrated steady progress from ideation to prototype implementation. While promising, evaluations show only incremental progress in real-world deployments, and the field still lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview and analysis of this new domain. We survey and systematize the field by focusing on three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-powered honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated attackers.",2025-11-20 12:38:58+00:00,2025-10-29 20:20:51+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25939v3
Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.",2025-10-29 20:12:42+00:00,2025-10-29 20:12:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934v1
FedSelect-ME: A Secure Multi-Edge Federated Learning Framework with Adaptive Client Scoring,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but suffers from limited scalability, high communication costs, and privacy risks due to its centralized architecture. This paper proposes FedSelect-ME, a hierarchical multi-edge FL framework that enhances scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Multiple edge servers distribute workloads and perform score-based client selection, prioritizing participants based on utility, energy efficiency, and data sensitivity. Secure Aggregation with Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy protects model updates from exposure and manipulation. Evaluated on the eICU healthcare dataset, FedSelect-ME achieves higher prediction accuracy, improved fairness across regions, and reduced communication overhead compared to FedAvg, FedProx, and FedSelect. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively addresses the bottlenecks of conventional FL, offering a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for large-scale, privacy-sensitive healthcare applications.",2025-10-29 18:32:08+00:00,2025-10-29 18:32:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01898v1
Model Inversion Attacks Meet Cryptographic Fuzzy Extractors,"Model inversion attacks pose an open challenge to privacy-sensitive applications that use machine learning (ML) models. For example, face authentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from face images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks can accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no systematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against model inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face authentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of best-effort solutions.   In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong defense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the cryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy extractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so through a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate of over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the first candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance comparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face authentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees, even in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and empirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face distributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any re-training of the ML model it protects. Empirically, it nullifies both prior state-of-the-art inversion attacks as well as our new PIPE attack.",2025-11-10 12:22:59+00:00,2025-10-29 16:50:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25687v2
ZK-SenseLM: Verifiable Large-Model Wireless Sensing with Selective Abstention and Zero-Knowledge Attestation,"ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.",2025-11-10 14:51:36+00:00,2025-10-29 16:43:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25677v2
Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy,"A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast, captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$, where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals, including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under diverse perturbation regimes.",2025-10-29 16:36:00+00:00,2025-10-29 16:36:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670v1
APThreatHunter: An automated planning-based threat hunting framework,"Cyber attacks threaten economic interests, critical infrastructure, and public health and safety. To counter this, entities adopt cyber threat hunting, a proactive approach that involves formulating hypotheses and searching for attack patterns within organisational networks. Automating cyber threat hunting presents challenges, particularly in generating hypotheses, as it is a manually created and confirmed process, making it time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce APThreatHunter, an automated threat hunting solution that generates hypotheses with minimal human intervention, eliminating analyst bias and reducing time and cost. This is done by presenting possible risks based on the system's current state and a set of indicators to indicate whether any of the detected risks are happening or not. We evaluated APThreatHunter using real-world Android malware samples, and the results revealed the practicality of using automated planning for goal hypothesis generation in cyber threat hunting activities.",2025-10-29 08:15:46+00:00,2025-10-29 08:15:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25806v1
AgentCyTE: Leveraging Agentic AI to Generate Cybersecurity Training & Experimentation Scenarios,"Designing realistic and adaptive networked threat scenarios remains a core challenge in cybersecurity research and training, still requiring substantial manual effort. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automated synthesis, unconstrained generation often yields configurations that fail validation or execution. We present AgentCyTE, a framework integrating LLM-based reasoning with deterministic, schema-constrained network emulation to generate and refine executable threat environments. Through an agentic feedback loop, AgentCyTE observes scenario outcomes, validates correctness, and iteratively enhances realism and consistency. This hybrid approach preserves LLM flexibility while enforcing structural validity, enabling scalable, data-driven experimentation and reliable scenario generation for threat modeling and adaptive cybersecurity training.

Attention Augmented GNN RNN-Attention Models for Advanced Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection,"In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.",2025-10-29 03:47:02+00:00,2025-10-29 03:47:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25802v1
Design and Optimization of Cloud Native Homomorphic Encryption Workflows for Privacy-Preserving ML Inference,"As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data, allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs. However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity, and model compatibility issues.   This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore, optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality under zero-trust cloud conditions.",2025-10-28 15:13:32+00:00,2025-10-28 15:13:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24498v1
Your Microphone Array Retains Your Identity: A Robust Voice Liveness Detection System for Smart Speakers,"Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed user gestures.   In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to existing passive liveness detection schemes.",2025-10-28 13:05:30+00:00,2025-10-28 13:05:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24393v1
Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench): A Meta-Benchmark for Evaluating Cybersecurity AI Agents,"Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs, Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges (RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench). Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step adversarial (A\&D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets (22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to 2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability, emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.",2025-10-28 11:36:20+00:00,2025-10-28 11:36:20+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24317v1
Traceable Signatures from Lattices,"Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures, but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason, they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers.

Covert Surveillance in Smart Devices: A SCOUR Framework Analysis of Youth Privacy Implications,"This paper investigates how smart devices covertly capture private conversations and discusses in more in-depth the implications of this for youth privacy. Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The findings have significant implications for policy development and the transparency of data collection for smart devices.",2025-10-28 05:10:10+00:00,2025-10-28 05:10:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24072v1
Learning to Attack: Uncovering Privacy Risks in Sequential Data Releases,"Privacy concerns have become increasingly critical in modern AI and data science applications, where sensitive information is collected, analyzed, and shared across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility. While prior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many real-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing, where the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential disclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across releases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains hidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an attacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting dependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual release satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel attack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a Hidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional inference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and later observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate our framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary can recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive experiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model consistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release independently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to sequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can collectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These findings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that explicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy or sequential data obfuscation strategies.",2025-10-28 04:32:42+00:00,2025-10-28 04:32:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24807v1
LLMLogAnalyzer: A Clustering-Based Log Analysis Chatbot using Large Language Models,"System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes. This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks. LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and non-technical users.",2025-10-28 03:29:55+00:00,2025-10-28 03:29:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24031v1
Scalable GPU-Based Integrity Verification for Large Machine Learning Models,"We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g., Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU infrastructures.",2025-10-27 23:45:21+00:00,2025-10-27 23:45:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23938v1
Differential Privacy: Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning Environments,"Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task, and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks, albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data security and privacy.",2025-10-27 23:33:21+00:00,2025-10-27 23:33:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23931v1
Victim as a Service: Designing a System for Engaging with Interactive Scammers,"Pig butchering, and similar interactive online scams, lower their victims' defenses by building trust over extended periods of conversation - sometimes weeks or months. They have become increasingly public losses (at least $75B by one recent study). However, because of their long-term conversational nature, they are extremely challenging to investigate at scale. In this paper, we describe the motivation, design, implementation, and experience with CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system that automates long-term engagement with online scammers, making large-scale investigations of their tactics possible. We describe the techniques we have developed to attract scam attempts, the system and LLM-engineering required to convincingly engage with scammers, and the necessary capabilities required to satisfy or evade ""milestones"" in scammers' workflow.",2025-10-27 23:19:29+00:00,2025-10-27 23:19:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23927v1
PRO: Enabling Precise and Robust Text Watermark for Open-Source LLMs,"Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability. A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria. A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits. Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications.",2025-10-27 22:00:49+00:00,2025-10-27 22:00:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23891v1
Towards a Functionally Complete and Parameterizable TFHE Processor,"Fully homomorphic encryption allows the evaluation of arbitrary functions on encrypted data. It can be leveraged to secure outsourced and multiparty computation. TFHE is a fast torus-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme that allows both linear operations, as well as the evaluation of arbitrary non-linear functions. It currently provides the fastest bootstrapping operation performance of any other FHE scheme. Despite its fast performance, TFHE suffers from a considerably higher computational overhead for the evaluation of homomorphic circuits. Computations in the encrypted domain are orders of magnitude slower than their unencrypted equivalents. This bottleneck hinders the widespread adoption of (T)FHE for the protection of sensitive data. While state-of-the-art implementations focused on accelerating and outsourcing single operations, their scalability and practicality are constrained by high memory bandwidth costs. In order to overcome this, we propose an FPGA-based hardware accelerator for the evaluation of homomorphic circuits. Specifically, we design a functionally complete TFHE processor for FPGA hardware capable of processing instructions on the data completely on the FPGA. In order to achieve a higher throughput from our TFHE processor, we implement an improved programmable bootstrapping module which outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 240\% to 480\% more bootstrappings per second. Our efficient, compact, and scalable design lays the foundation for implementing complete FPGA-based TFHE processor architectures.",2025-10-27 16:16:40+00:00,2025-10-27 16:16:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23483v1
"Authentication Against Insecure Bootstrapping for 5G Networks: Feasibility, Resiliency, and Transitional Solutions in Post-Quantum Era","The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station authentication mechanism during the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake base station attacks. Conventional solutions, including digital signatures based on Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) and identity-based signatures, are inadequate against quantum-capable adversaries. While integrating NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards is a leading approach for quantum resistance, their suitability for 5G base station authentication remains unexplored. Moreover, current solutions are predominantly centralized and lack security features such as distributed authentication. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance characterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital signatures (including threshold and identity-based schemes) into 5G base station authentication. Our findings reveal significant feasibility concerns, with direct PQC adoption hindered by protocol constraints and large signature sizes. We also highlight the performance limitations of conventional methods due to the overhead of certificate chains. To mitigate these challenges, we propose BORG, a transitional authentication solution based on a Hierarchical Identity-Based Threshold Signature scheme with a Fail-Stop property. BORG offers post-mortem post-quantum forgery detection and distributed trust via threshold and compact signatures, well-suited for 5G's stringent requirements. Our performance analysis underscores an important warning on the infeasibility of direct PQC integration and positions BORG as an effective transitional solution toward future quantum-resilient 5G authentication.",2025-10-27 15:56:59+00:00,2025-10-27 15:56:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23457v1

Floating-Point Neural Network Verification at the Software Level,"The behaviour of neural network components must be proven correct before deployment in safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, existing neural network verification techniques cannot certify the absence of faults at the software level. In this paper, we show how to specify and verify that neural networks are safe, by explicitly reasoning about their floating-point implementation. In doing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural network verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers, and full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is written in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct the first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on neural network code. The results show that existing automated verification tools can correctly solve an average of 11% of our benchmark, while producing around 3% incorrect verdicts. At the same time, a historical analysis reveals that the release of our benchmark has already had a significantly positive impact on the latter.",2025-10-27 14:43:19+00:00,2025-10-27 14:43:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23389v1
Network Intrusion Detection: Evolution from Conventional Approaches to LLM Collaboration and Emerging Risks,"This survey systematizes the evolution of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), from conventional methods such as signature-based and neural network (NN)-based approaches to recent integrations with large language models (LLMs). It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS. Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed, including conventional network infrastructures, autonomous vehicle environments and IoT environments.   From this survey, readers will learn that: 1) the earliest methods, signature-based IDSs, continue to make significant contributions to modern systems, despite their well-known weaknesses; 2) NN-based detection, although considered promising and under development for more than two decades, and despite numerous related approaches, still faces significant challenges in practical deployment; 3) LLMs are useful for NIDS in many cases, and a number of related approaches have been proposed; however, they still face significant challenges in practical applications. Moreover, they can even be exploited as offensive tools, such as for generating malware, crafting phishing messages, or launching cyberattacks. Recently, several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, which are also reviewed in this survey; and 4) strategies for constructing domain-specific LLMs have been proposed and are outlined in this survey, as it is nearly impossible to train a NIDS-specific LLM from scratch.",2025-11-09 12:44:18+00:00,2025-10-27 13:21:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23313v2
QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents,"Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors, leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.",2025-10-27 07:04:08+00:00,2025-10-27 07:04:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675v1
A Multi-Store Privacy Measurement of Virtual Reality App Ecosystem,"Virtual Reality (VR) has gained increasing traction among various domains in recent years, with major companies such as Meta, Pico, and Microsoft launching their application stores to support third-party developers in releasing their applications (or simply apps). These apps offer rich functionality but inherently collect privacy-sensitive data, such as user biometrics, behaviors, and the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of domain-specific regulations to govern the data handling of VR apps, resulting in significant variations in their privacy practices among app stores.   In this work, we present the first comprehensive multi-store study of privacy practices in the current VR app ecosystem, covering a large-scale dataset involving 6,565 apps collected from five major app stores. We assess both declarative and behavioral privacy practices of VR apps, using a multi-faceted approach based on natural language processing, reverse engineering, and static analysis. Our assessment reveals significant privacy compliance issues across all stores, underscoring the premature status of privacy protection in this rapidly growing ecosystem. For instance, one third of apps fail to declare their use of sensitive data, and 21.5\% of apps neglect to provide valid privacy policies. Our work sheds light on the status quo of privacy protection within the VR app ecosystem for the first time. Our findings should raise an alert to VR app developers and users, and encourage store operators to implement stringent regulations on privacy compliance among VR apps.",2025-10-27 05:42:29+00:00,2025-10-27 05:42:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23024v1
SpoofTrackBench: Interpretable AI for Spoof-Aware UAV Tracking and Benchmarking,"SpoofTrackBench is a reproducible, modular benchmark for evaluating adversarial robustness in real-time localization and tracking (RTLS) systems under radar spoofing. Leveraging the Hampton University Skyler Radar Sensor dataset, we simulate drift, ghost, and mirror-type spoofing attacks and evaluate tracker performance using both Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) and Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) architectures. Our framework separates clean and spoofed detection streams, visualizes spoof-induced trajectory divergence, and quantifies assignment errors via direct drift-from-truth metrics. Clustering overlays, injection-aware timelines, and scenario-adaptive visualizations enable interpretability across spoof types and configurations. Evaluation figures and logs are auto-exported for reproducible comparison. SpoofTrackBench sets a new standard for open, ethical benchmarking of spoof-aware tracking pipelines, enabling rigorous cross-architecture analysis and community validation.",2025-10-26 15:54:16+00:00,2025-10-26 15:54:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22726v1
Blockchain Signatures to Ensure Information Integrity and Non-Repudiation in the Digital Era: A comprehensive study,"Blockchain systems rely on decentralized ledgers and strong security guarantees. A key requirement is non-repudiation, which prevents denial of transaction authorship and supports integrity of recorded data. This work surveys digital signature schemes used in blockchain platforms and analyzes how they deliver non-repudiation and contribute to overall system security. We examine representative scheme families and their cryptographic foundations, security assumptions, and properties relevant to deployment, including unforgeability, resistance to malleability, support for aggregation and multisignature or threshold settings, key and signature sizes, and verification cost. Using these criteria, we compare the suitability of different designs for consensus protocols, smart contract constraints, and resource limits. We highlight practical tradeoffs that affect throughput, storage, scalability, and attack surfaces, and summarize benefits and limitations of each scheme in blockchain contexts. The study underscores that carefully chosen digital signatures are central to achieving non-repudiation and preserving information integrity, and it outlines implementation considerations and open directions such as interoperability and post-quantum readiness.",2025-10-26 07:39:55+00:00,2025-10-26 07:39:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22561v1
ZK Coprocessor Bridge: Replay-Safe Private Execution from Solana to Aztec via Wormhole,"We formalize a cross-domain ""ZK coprocessor bridge"" that lets Solana programs request private execution on Aztec L2 (via Ethereum) using Wormhole Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs) as authenticated transport. The system comprises: (i) a Solana program that posts messages to Wormhole Core with explicit finality; (ii) an EVM Portal that verifies VAAs, enforces a replay lock, parses a bound payload secretHash||m from the attested VAA, derives a domain-separated field commitment, and enqueues an L1->L2 message into the Aztec Inbox (our reference implementation v0.1.0 currently uses consumeWithSecret(vaa, secretHash); we provide migration guidance to the payload-bound interface); (iii) a minimal Aztec contract that consumes the message privately; and (iv) an off-chain relayer that ferries VAAs and can record receipts on Solana. We present state machines, message formats, and proof sketches for replay-safety, origin authenticity, finality alignment, parameter binding (no relayer front-running of Aztec parameters), privacy, idempotence, and liveness. Finally, we include a concise Reproducibility note with pinned versions and artifacts to replicate a public testnet run.",2025-10-26 05:06:56+00:00,2025-10-26 05:06:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22536v1
Privacy-Aware Federated nnU-Net for ECG Page Digitization,"Deep neural networks can convert ECG page images into analyzable waveforms, yet centralized training often conflicts with cross-institutional privacy and deployment constraints. A cross-silo federated digitization framework is presented that trains a full-model nnU-Net segmentation backbone without sharing images and aggregates updates across sites under realistic non-IID heterogeneity (layout, grid style, scanner profile, noise).   The protocol integrates three standard server-side aggregators--FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdam--and couples secure aggregation with central, user-level differential privacy to align utility with formal guarantees. Key features include: (i) end-to-end full-model training and synchronization across clients; (ii) secure aggregation so the server only observes a clipped, weighted sum once a participation threshold is met; (iii) central Gaussian DP with Renyi accounting applied post-aggregation for auditable user-level privacy; and (iv) a calibration-aware digitization pipeline comprising page normalization, trace segmentation, grid-leakage suppression, and vectorization to twelve-lead signals.   Experiments on ECG pages rendered from PTB-XL show consistently faster convergence and higher late-round plateaus with adaptive server updates (FedAdam) relative to FedAvg and FedProx, while approaching centralized performance. The privacy mechanism maintains competitive accuracy while preventing exposure of raw images or per-client updates, yielding deployable, auditable guarantees suitable for multi-institution settings.",2025-10-25 18:10:05+00:00,2025-10-25 18:10:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22387v1
Adapting Noise-Driven PUF and AI for Secure WBG ICS: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Wide-bandgap (WBG) technologies offer unprecedented improvements in power system efficiency, size, and performance, but also introduce unique sensor corruption and cybersecurity risks in industrial control systems (ICS), particularly due to high-frequency noise and sophisticated cyber-physical threats. This proof-of-concept (PoC) study demonstrates the adaptation of a noise-driven physically unclonable function (PUF) and machine learning (ML)-assisted anomaly detection framework to the demanding environment of WBG-based ICS sensor pathways. By extracting entropy from unavoidable WBG switching noise (up to 100 kHz) as a PUF source, and simultaneously using this noise as a real-time threat indicator, the proposed system unites hardware-level authentication and anomaly detection. Our approach integrates hybrid machine learning (ML) models with adaptive Bayesian filtering, providing robust and low-latency detection capabilities resilient to both natural electromagnetic interference (EMI) and active adversarial manipulation. Through detailed simulations of WBG modules under benign and attack scenarios--including EMI injection, signal tampering, and node impersonation--we achieve 95% detection accuracy and sub-millisecond processing latency. These results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-driven, dual-use noise exploitation as a scalable ICS defense primitive. Our findings lay the groundwork for next-generation security strategies that leverage inherent device characteristics, bridging hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced protection of critical ICS infrastructure.",2025-10-25 12:57:55+00:00,2025-10-25 12:57:55+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22283v1
Power to the Clients: Federated Learning in a Dictatorship Setting,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks.",2025-10-25 04:02:04+00:00,2025-10-25 04:02:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22149v1
Jailbreak Mimicry: Automated Discovery of Narrative-Based Jailbreaks for Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt engineering attacks that exploit contextual framing to bypass safety mechanisms, posing significant risks in cybersecurity applications. We introduce Jailbreak Mimicry, a systematic methodology for training compact attacker models to automatically generate narrative-based jailbreak prompts in a one-shot manner. Our approach transforms adversarial prompt discovery from manual craftsmanship into a reproducible scientific process, enabling proactive vulnerability assessment in AI-driven security systems. Developed for the OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B Red-Teaming Challenge, we use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) on Mistral-7B with a curated dataset derived from AdvBench, achieving an 81.0% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against GPT-OSS-20B on a held-out test set of 200 items. Cross-model evaluation reveals significant variation in vulnerability patterns: our attacks achieve 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% on Llama-3 and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating both broad applicability and model-specific defensive strengths in cybersecurity contexts. This represents a 54x improvement over direct prompting (1.5% ASR) and demonstrates systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches. Our analysis reveals that technical domains (Cybersecurity: 93% ASR) and deception-based attacks (Fraud: 87.8% ASR) are particularly vulnerable, highlighting threats to AI-integrated threat detection, malware analysis, and secure systems, while physical harm categories show greater resistance (55.6% ASR). We employ automated harmfulness evaluation using Claude Sonnet 4, cross-validated with human expert assessment, ensuring reliable and scalable evaluation for cybersecurity red-teaming. Finally, we analyze failure mechanisms and discuss defensive strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities in AI for cybersecurity.",2025-10-24 23:53:16+00:00,2025-10-24 23:53:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22085v1
Differentially Private High-dimensional Variable Selection via Integer Programming,"Sparse variable selection improves interpretability and generalization in high-dimensional learning by selecting a small subset of informative features. Recent advances in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) have enabled solving large-scale non-private sparse regression - known as Best Subset Selection (BSS) - with millions of variables in minutes. However, extending these algorithmic advances to the setting of Differential Privacy (DP) has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce two new pure differentially private estimators for sparse variable selection, levering modern MIP techniques. Our framework is general and applies broadly to problems like sparse regression or classification, and we provide theoretical support recovery guarantees in the case of BSS. Inspired by the exponential mechanism, we develop structured sampling procedures that efficiently explore the non-convex objective landscape, avoiding the exhaustive combinatorial search in the exponential mechanism. We complement our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments, using both least squares and hinge loss for our objective function, and demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art empirical support recovery, outperforming competing algorithms in settings with up to $p=10^4$.",2025-10-24 22:57:33+00:00,2025-10-24 22:57:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22062v1
Security Analysis of LTE Connectivity in Connected Cars: A Case Study of Tesla,"Modern connected vehicles rely on persistent LTE connectivity to enable remote diagnostics, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and critical safety services. While mobile network vulnerabilities are well documented in the smartphone ecosystem, their impact in safety-critical automotive settings remains insufficiently examined. In this work, we conduct a black-box, non-invasive security analysis of LTE connectivity in Tesla vehicles, including the Model 3 and Cybertruck, revealing systemic protocol weaknesses and architectural misconfigurations. We find that Tesla's telematics stack is susceptible to IMSI catching, rogue base station hijacking, and insecure fallback mechanisms that may silently degrade service availability. Furthermore, legacy control-plane configurations allow for silent SMS injection and broadcast message spoofing without driver awareness. These vulnerabilities have implications beyond a single vendor as they challenge core assumptions in regulatory frameworks like ISO/SAE 21434 and UN R155/R156, which require secure, traceable, and resilient telematics for type approval of modern vehicles.",2025-10-24 21:03:48+00:00,2025-10-24 21:03:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22024v1
$δ$-STEAL: LLM Stealing Attack with Local Differential Privacy,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related to intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks, where adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services. These attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats to revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking solution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model traceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $δ$-STEAL, a novel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark detectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $δ$-STEAL injects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during fine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect outputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise to these pairs, $δ$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it difficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used, thereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that $δ$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of up to $96.95\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model utility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack effectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust watermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors and undermine current intellectual property protection methods.",2025-10-24 18:19:38+00:00,2025-10-24 18:19:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21946v1
PTMF: A Privacy Threat Modeling Framework for IoT with Expert-Driven Threat Propagation Analysis,"Previous studies on PTA have focused on analyzing privacy threats based on the potential areas of occurrence and their likelihood of occurrence. However, an in-depth understanding of the threat actors involved, their actions, and the intentions that result in privacy threats is essential. In this paper, we present a novel Privacy Threat Model Framework (PTMF) that analyzes privacy threats through different phases.   The PTMF development is motivated through the selected tactics from the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and techniques from the LINDDUN privacy threat model, making PTMF a privacy-centered framework. The proposed PTMF can be employed in various ways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy threats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this paper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by developing a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both industry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their opinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat actors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11 privacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the critical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining 11 privacy threats. This study could provide a solid foundation for understanding how and where privacy measures can be proactively and effectively deployed in IoT systems to mitigate privacy threats based on the activities and intentions of threat actors within these systems.",2025-10-24 16:06:04+00:00,2025-10-24 16:06:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21601v1
Actionable Cybersecurity Notifications for Smart Homes: A User Study on the Role of Length and Complexity,"The proliferation of smart home devices has increased convenience but also introduced cybersecurity risks for everyday users, as many devices lack robust security features. Intrusion Detection Systems are a prominent approach to detecting cybersecurity threats. However, their alerts often use technical terms and require users to interpret them correctly, which is challenging for a typical smart home user. Large Language Models can bridge this gap by translating IDS alerts into actionable security notifications. However, it has not yet been clear what an actionable cybersecurity notification should look like. In this paper, we conduct an experimental online user study with 130 participants to examine how the length and complexity of LLM-generated notifications affect user likability, understandability, and motivation to act. Our results show that intermediate-complexity notifications are the most effective across all user groups, regardless of their technological proficiency. Across the board, users rated beginner-level messages as more effective when they were longer, while expert-level messages were rated marginally more effective when they were shorter. These findings provide insights for designing security notifications that are both actionable and broadly accessible to smart home users.",2025-10-24 14:36:35+00:00,2025-10-24 14:36:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21508v1
FLAMES: Fine-tuning LLMs to Synthesize Invariants for Smart Contract Security,"Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime guards as Solidity ""require"" statements to harden smart contracts against exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000 challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to enable reproducible research in this critical domain.",2025-10-24 12:44:08+00:00,2025-10-24 12:44:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21401v1
Securing AI Agent Execution,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9% accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions for declarative access control and MCP security.",2025-10-29 13:11:21+00:00,2025-10-24 08:10:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21236v2
The Trojan Example: Jailbreaking LLMs through Template Filling and Unsafety Reasoning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly and now encode extensive world knowledge. Despite safety fine-tuning, however, they remain susceptible to adversarial prompts that elicit harmful content. Existing jailbreak techniques fall into two categories: white-box methods (e.g., gradient-based approaches such as GCG), which require model internals and are infeasible for closed-source APIs, and black-box methods that rely on attacker LLMs to search or mutate prompts but often produce templates that lack explainability and transferability. We introduce TrojFill, a black-box jailbreak that reframes unsafe instruction as a template-filling task. TrojFill embeds obfuscated harmful instructions (e.g., via placeholder substitution or Caesar/Base64 encoding) inside a multi-part template that asks the model to (1) reason why the original instruction is unsafe (unsafety reasoning) and (2) generate a detailed example of the requested text, followed by a sentence-by-sentence analysis. The crucial ""example"" component acts as a Trojan Horse that contains the target jailbreak content while the surrounding task framing reduces refusal rates. We evaluate TrojFill on standard jailbreak benchmarks across leading LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen), showing strong empirical performance (e.g., 100% attack success on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1, and 97% on GPT-4o). Moreover, the generated prompts exhibit improved interpretability and transferability compared with prior black-box optimization approaches. We release our code, sample prompts, and generated outputs to support future red-teaming research.",2025-10-24 06:43:10+00:00,2025-10-24 06:43:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21190v1
DictPFL: Efficient and Private Federated Learning on Encrypted Gradients,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes: encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL, a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation. It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and 4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.",2025-10-24 01:58:42+00:00,2025-10-24 01:58:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21086v1
A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust and Secure LLM Watermarking,"Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for tracing and authenticating text generated by large language models (LLMs). A common approach to LLM watermarking is to construct a green/red token list and assign higher or lower generation probabilities to the corresponding tokens, respectively. However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic green/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges. First, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability, text quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing attacks. Directly optimizing for these criteria introduces many partially conflicting reward terms, leading to an unstable convergence process. Second, the vast action space of green/red token list choices is susceptible to reward hacking. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RL framework for robust and secure LLM watermarking. Our approach adopts an anchoring mechanism for reward terms to ensure stable training and introduces additional regularization terms to prevent reward hacking. Experiments on standard benchmarks with two backbone LLMs show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off across all criteria, with notable improvements in resistance to spoofing attacks without degrading other criteria. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/RL-watermark.",2025-10-23 23:53:03+00:00,2025-10-23 23:53:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21053v1
An Experimental Study of Trojan Vulnerabilities in UAV Autonomous Landing,"This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations. We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy, from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.",2025-10-23 18:47:40+00:00,2025-10-23 18:47:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20932v1
Kernel Learning with Adversarial Features: Numerical Efficiency and Adaptive Regularization,"Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.",2025-10-23 17:34:51+00:00,2025-10-23 17:34:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20883v1
Adversarially-Aware Architecture Design for Robust Medical AI Systems,"Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare, capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations. Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates, they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.",2025-10-23 16:51:11+00:00,2025-10-23 16:51:11+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23622v1
Risk Psychology & Cyber-Attack Tactics,"We examine whether measured cognitive processes predict cyber-attack behavior. We analyzed data that included psychometric scale responses and labeled attack behaviors from cybersecurity professionals who conducted red-team operations against a simulated enterprise network. We employed multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression with technique counts nested within participants to test whether cognitive processes predicted technique-specific usage. The scales significantly predicted technique use, but effects varied by technique rather than operating uniformly. Neither expertise level nor experimental treatment condition significantly predicted technique patterns, indicating that cognitive processes may be stronger drivers of technique selection than training or experience. These findings demonstrate that individual cognitive differences shape cyber-attack behavior and support the development of psychology-informed defense strategies.",2025-10-23 15:31:47+00:00,2025-10-23 15:31:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20657v1
Adversary-Aware Private Inference over Wireless Channels,"AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.",2025-10-23 13:02:14+00:00,2025-10-23 13:02:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20518v1
On the cybersecurity of LoRaWAN-based system: a Smart-Lighting case study,"Cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are key technologies in the Industry 4.0 vision. They incorporate sensors and actuators to interact with the physical environment. However, when creating and interconnecting components to form a heterogeneous smart systems architecture, these face challenges in cybersecurity. This paper presents an experimental investigation of architectural configurations for a LoRaWAN-based Smart-Lighting project, aimed at verifying and improving the system's robustness against attacks. We assess the system's robustness in a series of iterative experiments conducted both in-vitro and on-site. The results show that most attacks on a LoRaWAN network are unsuccessful, also highlighting unresolved issues with the installed products. The most successful attacks are high-power jamming attacks within a few meters of the target, which, in the case of gateways, can be mitigated through gateway redundancy.",2025-10-23 12:36:23+00:00,2025-10-23 12:36:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20494v1
Transferable Black-Box One-Shot Forging of Watermarks via Image Preference Models,"Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.",2025-10-23 12:06:35+00:00,2025-10-23 12:06:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20468v1
In-DRAM True Random Number Generation Using Simultaneous Multiple-Row Activation: An Experimental Study of Real DRAM Chips,"In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to generate true random numbers at high throughput and low latency in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips by leveraging simultaneous multiple-row activation (SiMRA) via an extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips. We rigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of entropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously activated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature levels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we highlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find that all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-, 16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart DRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x, respectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of simultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and conditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy. For example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row activation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example, increasing the temperature from 50°C to 90°C decreases SiMRA's entropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development, we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG.",2025-10-23 06:54:58+00:00,2025-10-23 06:54:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20269v1
QORE : Quantum Secure 5G/B5G Core,"Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman (DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment (UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC (HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and integrity of network data.",2025-10-22 19:28:58+00:00,2025-10-22 19:28:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19982v1
SecureInfer: Heterogeneous TEE-GPU Architecture for Privacy-Critical Tensors for Large Language Model Deployment,"With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile and edge platforms, securing them against model extraction attacks has become a pressing concern. However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy: security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance, offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.",2025-10-22 19:17:31+00:00,2025-10-22 19:17:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19979v1
Towards Strong Certified Defense with Universal Asymmetric Randomization,"Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally \underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic \underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric (anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different $\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions, allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to $182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at \href{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}}",2025-10-22 19:14:26+00:00,2025-10-22 19:14:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19977v1
Q-RAN: Quantum-Resilient O-RAN Architecture,"The telecommunications industry faces a dual transformation: the architectural shift toward Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) and the emerging threat from quantum computing. O-RAN disaggregated, multi-vendor architecture creates a larger attack surface vulnerable to crypt-analytically relevant quantum computers(CRQCs) that will break current public key cryptography. The Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attack strategy makes this threat immediate, as adversaries can intercept encrypted data today for future decryption. This paper presents Q-RAN, a comprehensive quantum-resistant security framework for O-RAN networks using NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). We detail the implementation of ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204), integrated with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) for cryptographic entropy. The solution deploys PQ-IPsec, PQ-DTLS, and PQ-mTLS protocols across all O-RAN interfaces, anchored by a centralized Post-Quantum Certificate Authority (PQ-CA) within the SMO framework.

Designing a Secure and Resilient Distributed Smartphone Participant Data Collection System,"Real-world health studies require continuous and secure data collection from mobile and wearable devices. We introduce MotionPI, a smartphone-based system designed to collect behavioral and health data through sensors and surveys with minimal interaction from participants. The system integrates passive data collection (such as GPS and wristband motion data) with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) surveys, which can be triggered randomly or based on physical activity. MotionPI is designed to work under real-life constraints, including limited battery life, weak or intermittent cellular connection, and minimal user supervision. It stores data both locally and on a secure cloud server, with encrypted transmission and storage. It integrates through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) into wristband devices that store raw data and communicate motion summaries and trigger events.

Mitigating Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Federated Learning via $f$-Differential Privacy,"Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server. However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication, and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield consistently tighter $(ε,δ)$ bounds and improved utility compared to Rényi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in decentralized privacy accounting.",2025-10-22 18:01:08+00:00,2025-10-22 18:01:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19934v1
Everyone Needs AIR: An Agnostic Incident Reporting Framework for Cybersecurity in Operational Technology,"Operational technology (OT) networks are increasingly coupled with information technology (IT), expanding the attack surface and complicating incident response. Although OT standards emphasise incident reporting and evidence preservation, they do not specify what data to capture during an incident, which hinders coordination across stakeholders. In contrast, IT guidance defines reporting content but does not address OT constraints. This paper presents the Agnostic Incident Reporting (AIR) framework for live OT incident reporting. AIR comprises 25 elements organised into seven groups to capture incident context, chronology, impacts, and actions, tailored to technical, managerial, and regulatory needs. We evaluate AIR by mapping it to major OT standards, defining activation points for integration and triggering established OT frameworks, and then retrospectively applying it to the 2015 Ukrainian distribution grid incident. The evaluation indicates that AIR translates high-level requirements into concrete fields, overlays existing frameworks without vendor dependence, and can support situational awareness and communication during response. AIR offers a basis for standardising live OT incident reporting while supporting technical coordination and regulatory alignment.",2025-10-22 16:54:35+00:00,2025-10-22 16:54:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20858v1

These models are specifically designed for online detection and are trained using the generated dataset.

Exploring the Effect of DNN Depth on Adversarial Attacks in Network Intrusion Detection Systems,"Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to Machine Learning (ML) systems and especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by subtly manipulating inputs to induce incorrect predictions. This paper investigates whether increasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness against adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) domain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks across both \ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used in adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the NIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance, yet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial attacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits a more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of robust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique characteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape.",2025-10-22 16:48:35+00:00,2025-10-22 16:48:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19761v1
Analysis and Comparison of Known and Randomly Generated S-boxes for Block Ciphers,"Mathematically constructed S-boxes arise from algebraic structures and finite field theory to ensure strong, provable cryptographic properties. These mathematically grounded constructions allow for generation of thousands of S-Boxes with high nonlinearity, APN properties, and balanced avalanche characteristics, unlike fully random methods, which lack such theoretical guarantees in exchange for low complexity and more varied results. In this work, we compare mathematically constructed constructions with randomly generated ones to evaluate the relative weakness of the latter. We also establish an average measure of performance for randomly generated permutations, as well as random with forced cycle constraints, and compare them to well-established designs in a simple SPN setting.",2025-10-22 15:55:23+00:00,2025-10-22 15:55:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19885v1
FidelityGPT: Correcting Decompilation Distortions with Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.",2025-10-22 14:11:44+00:00,2025-10-22 14:11:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19615v1
Can You Trust What You See? Alpha Channel No-Box Attacks on Video Object Detection,"As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this paper, we present α-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos. α-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate α-Cloak on five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.",2025-10-22 13:27:02+00:00,2025-10-22 13:27:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19574v1
Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains,"Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure",2025-10-22 11:35:51+00:00,2025-10-22 11:35:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19491v1
AegisMCP: Online Graph Intrusion Detection for Tool-Augmented LLMs on Edge Devices,"In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent toolchains and their applications in smart homes.

Monitoring LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Against Corruptions via Node Evaluation,"Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy applications.

From See to Shield: ML-Assisted Fine-Grained Access Control for Visual Data,"As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision (10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1 second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.",2025-10-22 09:41:31+00:00,2025-10-22 09:41:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19418v1
Bytecode-centric Detection of Known-to-be-vulnerable Dependencies in Java Projects,"On average, 71% of the code in typical Java projects comes from open-source software (OSS) dependencies, making OSS dependencies the dominant component of modern software code bases. This high degree of OSS reliance comes with a considerable security risk of adding known security vulnerabilities to a code base. To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various dependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable OSS dependencies. However, there are still challenges that modern dependency scanners do not overcome, especially when it comes to dependency modifications, such as re-compilations, re-bundlings or re-packagings, which are common in the Java ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a bytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the metadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available but directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular OSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency scanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies. It is the only scanner capable of identifying vulnerabilities across all the above mentioned types of modifications. But even when applied to unmodified dependencies, Jaralyzer outperforms the current state-of-the-art code-centric scanner Eclipse Steady by detecting 28 more true vulnerabilities and yielding 29 fewer false warnings.",2025-10-22 09:08:46+00:00,2025-10-22 09:08:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19393v1
A Probabilistic Computing Approach to the Closest Vector Problem for Lattice-Based Factoring,"The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems, including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical methods.",2025-10-22 09:06:08+00:00,2025-10-22 09:06:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19390v1
ConvXformer: Differentially Private Hybrid ConvNeXt-Transformer for Inertial Navigation,"Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer, a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning accuracy while ensuring $(ε,δ)$-differential privacy guarantees. To validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical systems.",2025-10-22 08:20:31+00:00,2025-10-22 08:20:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19352v1
Authorization of Knowledge-base Agents in an Intent-based Management Function,"As networks move toward the next-generation 6G, Intent-based Management (IbM) systems are increasingly adopted to simplify and automate network management by translating high-level intents into low-level configurations. Within these systems, agents play a critical role in monitoring current state of the network, gathering data, and enforcing actions across the network to fulfill the intent. However, ensuring secure and fine-grained authorization of agents remains a significant challenge, especially in dynamic and multi-tenant environments. Traditional models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relational-Based Access Control (RelBAC) often lack the flexibility to accommodate the evolving context and granularity required by intentbased operations. In this paper, we propose an enhanced authorization framework that integrates contextual and functional attributes with agent roles to achieve dynamic, policy-driven access control. By analyzing agent functionalities, our approach ensures that agents are granted only the minimal necessary privileges towards knowledge graphs.",2025-10-22 07:38:01+00:00,2025-10-22 07:38:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19324v1

Reliability and Resilience of AI-Driven Critical Network Infrastructure under Cyber-Physical Threats,"The increasing reliance on AI-driven 5G/6G network infrastructures for mission-critical services highlights the need for reliability and resilience against sophisticated cyber-physical threats. These networks are highly exposed to novel attack surfaces due to their distributed intelligence, virtualized resources, and cross-domain integration. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant and resilience-aware framework that integrates AI-driven anomaly detection, adaptive routing, and redundancy mechanisms to mitigate cascading failures under cyber-physical attack conditions. A comprehensive validation is carried out using NS-3 simulations, where key performance indicators such as reliability, latency, resilience index, and packet loss rate are analyzed under various attack scenarios.

An Empirical Study of Bitwise Operators Intuitiveness through Performance Metrics,"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the readability and understandability of bitwise operators in programming, with the main hypothesis that there will be a difference in the performance metrics (response time and error rate) between participants exposed to various bitwise operators related questions and those who are not.   Participants: Participants in this human research study include people without programming background, novice programmers, and university students with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23 participants in this study.   Study Methods: This study uses a within-subjects experimental design to assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in a JavaScript program, and their task completion times and task accuracy are recorded for analysis.   Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors predicting response time, showing a small but significant effect (R-squared = 0.032, F(1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001). Additionally, operators such as OR, NOT, and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times compared to other operators.   Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign for improved understandability.",2025-10-26 04:37:45+00:00,2025-10-22 06:30:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19281v2
LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery,"With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect.   LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness.   Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect.   These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.",2025-10-22 05:47:41+00:00,2025-10-22 05:47:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19264v1
Defending Against Prompt Injection with DataFilter,"When large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate tasks and interact with untrusted external data, prompt injection emerges as a significant security threat. By injecting malicious instructions into the data that LLMs access, an attacker can arbitrarily override the original user task and redirect the agent toward unintended, potentially harmful actions. Existing defenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur substantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system redesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time model-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before it reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning on simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data to selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information. Across multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt injection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs' utility. DataFilter delivers strong security, high utility, and plug-and-play deployment, making it a strong practical defense to secure black-box commercial LLMs against prompt injection. Our DataFilter model is released at https://huggingface.co/JoyYizhu/DataFilter for immediate use, with the code to reproduce our results at https://github.com/yizhu-joy/DataFilter.",2025-10-22 03:30:49+00:00,2025-10-22 03:30:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19207v1
"OpenGuardrails: A Configurable, Unified, and Scalable Guardrails Platform for Large Language Models","As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their safety, robustness, and privacy compliance has become critical. We present OpenGuardrails, the first fully open-source platform that unifies large-model-based safety detection, manipulation defense, and deployable guardrail infrastructure. OpenGuardrails protects against three major classes of risks: (1) content-safety violations such as harmful or explicit text generation, (2) model-manipulation attacks including prompt injection, jailbreaks, and code-interpreter abuse, and (3) data leakage involving sensitive or private information. Unlike prior modular or rule-based frameworks, OpenGuardrails introduces three core innovations: (1) a Configurable Policy Adaptation mechanism that allows per-request customization of unsafe categories and sensitivity thresholds; (2) a Unified LLM-based Guard Architecture that performs both content-safety and manipulation detection within a single model; and (3) a Quantized, Scalable Model Design that compresses a 14B dense base model to 3.3B via GPTQ while preserving over 98 of benchmark accuracy. The system supports 119 languages, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multilingual safety benchmarks, and can be deployed as a secure gateway or API-based service for enterprise use.

HAMLOCK: HArdware-Model LOgically Combined attacK,"The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities. Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a traceable layer-by-layer activation path.   This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAMLOCK), a far stealthier threat that distributes the attack logic across the hardware-software boundary. The software (model) is now only minimally altered by tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation values when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those unique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant bit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly manipulate the final output logits for misclassification.   This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no complete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears fully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible clean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art model-level defenses without any adaptive optimization. The hardware Trojan is also undetectable, incurring area and power overheads as low as 0.01%, which is easily masked by process and environmental noise. Our findings expose a critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, demanding new cross-layer defenses against this emerging threat.",2025-10-22 00:31:49+00:00,2025-10-22 00:31:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19145v1
Model Context Contracts - MCP-Enabled Framework to Integrate LLMs With Blockchain Smart Contracts,"In recent years, blockchain has experienced widespread adoption across various industries, becoming integral to numerous enterprise applications. Concurrently, the rise of generative AI and LLMs has transformed human-computer interactions, offering advanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI integration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data sources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for seamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this concern, we propose ""MCC: Model Context Contracts"" a novel framework that enables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through MCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart contracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between users and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with blockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language. Within this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as intelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and executing the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately interprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP functions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs paired with their corresponding MCP server functions. This fine-tuning process significantly improved the platform's performance and accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of MCC, we have developed an end-to-end prototype implemented on the Rahasak blockchain with the fine-tuned Llama-4 LLM. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first approach to using the concept of Model Context Protocol to integrate LLMs with blockchain.",2025-10-21 19:28:20+00:00,2025-10-21 19:28:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19856v1
sNVMe-oF: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage,"Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern data centers, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce sNVMe-oF, a storage management system extending the NVMe-oF protocol and adhering to the CC threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. sNVMe-oF offers an appropriate control path and novel concepts such as counter-leasing. sNVMe-oF also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata, introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), and avoiding redundant IPSec protections. We achieve this without modifying the NVMe-oF protocol. To prevent excessive resource usage while delivering line rate, sNVMe-oF also uses accelerators of CC-capable smart NICs. We prototype sNVMe-oF on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate how it can achieve as little as 2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns and AI training.",2025-10-21 16:01:36+00:00,2025-10-21 16:01:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756v1

HarmNet systematically explores and refines the adversarial space to uncover stealthy, high-success attack paths. Experiments across closed-source and open-source LLMs show that HarmNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher attack success rates.

Exploring Membership Inference Vulnerabilities in Clinical Large Language Models,"As large language models (LLMs) become progressively more embedded in clinical decision-support, documentation, and patient-information systems, ensuring their privacy and trustworthiness has emerged as an imperative challenge for the healthcare sector. Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic health record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of exposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress, we present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference vulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if specific patient records were used during model training. Using a state-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both canonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based perturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial conditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership leakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet remain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in clinical AI adoption. These results motivate continued development of context-aware, domain-specific privacy evaluations and defenses such as differential privacy fine-tuning and paraphrase-aware training, to strengthen the security and trustworthiness of healthcare AI systems.",2025-10-21 14:27:48+00:00,2025-10-21 14:27:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18674v1
Differentially Private E-Values,"E-values have gained prominence as flexible tools for statistical inference and risk control, enabling anytime- and post-hoc-valid procedures under minimal assumptions. However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare, and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and illustrate its broad applicability.",2025-10-21 14:03:35+00:00,2025-10-21 14:03:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18654v1
DRsam: Detection of Fault-Based Microarchitectural Side-Channel Attacks in RISC-V Using Statistical Preprocessing and Association Rule Mining,"RISC-V processors are becoming ubiquitous in critical applications, but their susceptibility to microarchitectural side-channel attacks is a serious concern. Detection of microarchitectural attacks in RISC-V is an emerging research topic that is relatively underexplored, compared to x86 and ARM. The first line of work to detect flush+fault-based microarchitectural attacks in RISC-V leverages Machine Learning (ML) models, yet it leaves several practical aspects that need further investigation. To address overlooked issues, we leveraged gem5 and propose a new detection method combining statistical preprocessing and association rule mining having reconfiguration capabilities to generalize the detection method for any microarchitectural attack. The performance comparison with state-of-the-art reveals that the proposed detection method achieves up to 5.15% increase in accuracy, 7% rise in precision, and 3.91% improvement in recall under the cryptographic, computational, and memory-intensive workloads alongside its flexibility to detect new variant of flush+fault attack. Moreover, as the attack detection relies on association rules, their human-interpretable nature provides deep insight to understand microarchitectural behavior during the execution of attack and benign applications.",2025-10-21 13:09:56+00:00,2025-10-21 13:09:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18612v1
Evaluating Large Language Models in detecting Secrets in Android Apps,"Mobile apps often embed authentication secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and client IDs, to integrate with cloud services. However, developers often hardcode these credentials into Android apps, exposing them to extraction through reverse engineering. Once compromised, adversaries can exploit secrets to access sensitive data, manipulate resources, or abuse APIs, resulting in significant security and financial risks. Existing detection approaches, such as regex-based analysis, static analysis, and machine learning, are effective for identifying known patterns but are fundamentally limited: they require prior knowledge of credential structures, API signatures, or training data.   In this paper, we propose SecretLoc, an LLM-based approach for detecting hardcoded secrets in Android apps. SecretLoc goes beyond pattern matching; it leverages contextual and structural cues to identify secrets without relying on predefined patterns or labeled training sets. Using a benchmark dataset from the literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-, static-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets. In total, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches, discovering more than 10 ""new"" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys, GitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more.   We further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where we uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a set of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which were confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our results reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with LLMs, so can attackers. This underscores the urgent need for proactive secret management and stronger mitigation practices across the mobile ecosystem.",2025-10-21 12:59:39+00:00,2025-10-21 12:59:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18601v1
CLASP: Cost-Optimized LLM-based Agentic System for Phishing Detection,"Phishing websites remain a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating accurate and cost-effective detection mechanisms. In this paper, we present CLASP, a novel system that effectively identifies phishing websites by leveraging multiple intelligent agents, built using large language models (LLMs), to analyze different aspects of a web resource. The system processes URLs or QR codes, employing specialized LLM-based agents that evaluate the URL structure, webpage screenshot, and HTML content to predict potential phishing threats. To optimize performance while minimizing operational costs, we experimented with multiple combination strategies for agent-based analysis, ultimately designing a strategic combination that ensures the per-website evaluation expense remains minimal without compromising detection accuracy. We tested various LLMs, including Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini, to build these agents and found that Gemini 1.5 Flash achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 83.01% on a newly curated dataset. Also, the system maintained an average processing time of 2.78 seconds per website and an API cost of around $3.18 per 1,000 websites. Moreover, CLASP surpasses leading previous solutions, achieving over 40% higher recall and a 20% improvement in F1 score for phishing detection on the collected dataset. To support further research, we have made our dataset publicly available, supporting the development of more advanced phishing detection systems.",2025-10-21 12:38:52+00:00,2025-10-21 12:38:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18585v1
Forward to Hell? On the Potentials of Misusing Transparent DNS Forwarders in Reflective Amplification Attacks,"The DNS infrastructure is infamous for facilitating reflective amplification attacks. Various countermeasures such as server shielding, access control, rate limiting, and protocol restrictions have been implemented. Still, the threat remains throughout the deployment of DNS servers. In this paper, we report on and evaluate the often unnoticed threat that derives from transparent DNS forwarders, a widely deployed, incompletely functional set of DNS components. Transparent DNS forwarders transfer DNS requests without rebuilding packets with correct source addresses. As such, transparent forwarders feed DNS requests into (mainly powerful and anycasted) open recursive resolvers, which thereby can be misused to participate unwillingly in distributed reflective amplification attacks. We show how transparent forwarders raise severe threats to the Internet infrastructure. They easily circumvent rate limiting and achieve an additional, scalable impact via the DNS anycast infrastructure. We empirically verify this scaling behavior up to a factor of 14. Transparent forwarders can also assist in bypassing firewall rules that protect recursive resolvers, making these shielded infrastructure entities part of the global DNS attack surface.",2025-10-22 10:52:26+00:00,2025-10-21 12:28:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18572v2
Deep Q-Learning Assisted Bandwidth Reservation for Multi-Operator Time-Sensitive Vehicular Networking,"Very few available individual bandwidth reservation schemes provide efficient and cost-effective bandwidth reservation that is required for safety-critical and time-sensitive vehicular networked applications. These schemes allow vehicles to make reservation requests for the required resources. Accordingly, a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) can allocate and guarantee bandwidth resources based on these requests. However, due to uncertainty in future reservation time and bandwidth costs, the design of an optimized reservation strategy is challenging. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective bandwidth reservation update approach with an optimal strategy based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). The key design objectives are to minimize the reservation cost with multiple MNOs and to ensure reliable resource provisioning in uncertain situations by solving scenarios such as underbooked and overbooked reservations along the driving path. The enhancements and advantages of our proposed strategy have been demonstrated through extensive experimental results when compared to other methods like greedy update or other deep reinforcement learning approaches. Our strategy demonstrates a 40% reduction in bandwidth costs across all investigated scenarios and simultaneously resolves uncertain situations in a cost-effective manner.",2025-10-21 12:03:21+00:00,2025-10-21 12:03:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18553v1
Pay Attention to the Triggers: Constructing Backdoors That Survive Distillation,"LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models. However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First, we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and across four model families of LLMs.",2025-10-21 11:39:45+00:00,2025-10-21 11:39:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18541v1
Prompting the Priorities: A First Look at Evaluating LLMs for Vulnerability Triage and Prioritization,"Security analysts face increasing pressure to triage large and complex vulnerability backlogs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential aid by automating parts of the interpretation process. We evaluate four models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek) across twelve prompting techniques to interpret semi-structured and unstructured vulnerability information. As a concrete use case, we test each model's ability to predict decision points in the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) framework: Exploitation, Automatable, Technical Impact, and Mission and Wellbeing.   Using 384 real-world vulnerabilities from the VulZoo dataset, we issued more than 165,000 queries to assess performance under prompting styles including one-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought. We report F1 scores for each SSVC decision point and Cohen's kappa (weighted and unweighted) for the final SSVC decision outcomes. Gemini consistently ranked highest, leading on three of four decision points and yielding the most correct recommendations. Prompting with exemplars generally improved accuracy, although all models struggled on some decision points. Only DeepSeek achieved fair agreement under weighted metrics, and all models tended to over-predict risk.   Overall, current LLMs do not replace expert judgment. However, specific LLM and prompt combinations show moderate effectiveness for targeted SSVC decisions. When applied with care, LLMs can support vulnerability prioritization workflows and help security teams respond more efficiently to emerging threats.",2025-10-21 10:48:14+00:00,2025-10-21 10:48:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18508v1

The study provides a detailed review of the threat actor identifiers and taxonomies used by leading cybersecurity vendors, focusing on the evolving attribution from Microsoft, ESET, and CrowdStrike researchers. Once the attribution to Ember Bear (GRU Unit 29155) is established through technical and intelligence reports, we use both traditional machine learning classifiers and a large language model (ChatGPT) to analyze the indicators of compromise (IoCs), tactics, and techniques to statistically and semantically attribute the WhisperGate attack. Our findings reveal overlapping indicators with the Sandworm group (GRU Unit 74455) but also strong evidence pointing to Ember Bear, especially when the LLM is fine-tuned or contextually augmented with additional intelligence. Thus, showing how AI/GenAI with proper fine-tuning are capable of solving the attribution challenge.",2025-10-21 10:04:49+00:00,2025-10-21 10:04:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18484v1
"Censorship Chokepoints: New Battlegrounds for Regional Surveillance, Censorship and Influence on the Internet","Undoubtedly, the Internet has become one of the most important conduits to information for the general public. Nonetheless, Internet access can be and has been limited systematically or blocked completely during political events in numerous countries and regions by various censorship mechanisms. Depending on where the core filtering component is situated, censorship techniques have been classified as client-based, server-based, or network-based. However, as the Internet evolves rapidly, new and sophisticated censorship techniques have emerged, which involve techniques that cut across locations and involve new forms of hurdles to information access.

Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG (Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL), a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional generator under strong privacy guarantees.",2025-10-21 02:31:31+00:00,2025-10-21 02:31:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18232v1
TaintSentinel: Path-Level Randomness Vulnerability Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts,"The inherent determinism of blockchain technology poses a significant challenge to generating secure random numbers within smart contracts, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems and blockchain-based gaming applications. From our observations, the current state-of-the-art detection tools suffer from inadequate precision while dealing with random number vulnerabilities. To address this problem, we propose TaintSentinel, a novel path sensitive vulnerability detection system designed to analyze smart contracts at the execution path level and gradually analyze taint with domain-specific rules. This paper discusses a solution that incorporates a multi-faceted approach, integrating rule-based taint analysis to track data flow, a dual stream neural network to identify complex vulnerability signatures, and evidence-based parameter initialization to minimize false positives. The system's two-phase operation involves semantic graph construction and taint propagation analysis, followed by pattern recognition using PathGNN and global structural analysis via GlobalGCN. Our experiments on 4,844 contracts demonstrate the superior performance of TaintSentinel relative to existing tools, yielding an F1-score of 0.892, an AUC-ROC of 0.94, and a PRA accuracy of 97%.",2025-10-21 00:35:45+00:00,2025-10-21 00:35:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18192v1
PrivaDE: Privacy-preserving Data Evaluation for Blockchain-based Data Marketplaces,"Evaluating the relevance of data is a critical task for model builders seeking to acquire datasets that enhance model performance. Ideally, such evaluation should allow the model builder to assess the utility of candidate data without exposing proprietary details of the model. At the same time, data providers must be assured that no information about their data - beyond the computed utility score - is disclosed to the model builder.   In this paper, we present PrivaDE, a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving utility scoring and selection of data for machine learning. While prior works have proposed data evaluation protocols, our approach advances the state of the art through a practical, blockchain-centric design. Leveraging the trustless nature of blockchains, PrivaDE enforces malicious-security guarantees and ensures strong privacy protection for both models and datasets. To achieve efficiency, we integrate several techniques - including model distillation, model splitting, and cut-and-choose zero-knowledge proofs - bringing the runtime to a practical level. Furthermore, we propose a unified utility scoring function that combines empirical loss, predictive entropy, and feature-space diversity, and that can be seamlessly integrated into active-learning workflows. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE performs data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15 minutes even for models with millions of parameters.   Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in decentralized machine learning ecosystems.",2025-10-20 21:14:32+00:00,2025-10-20 21:14:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18109v1
RL-Driven Security-Aware Resource Allocation Framework for UAV-Assisted O-RAN,"The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhances communication in disaster management and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by ensuring connectivity when infrastructure fails. However, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication, as delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as mobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource management, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing UAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of security, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our approach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware resource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is solved using RL. Unlike heuristic or static methods, our framework adapts in real-time to network dynamics, ensuring robust communication. Simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to heuristic baselines, achieving enhanced security and energy efficiency while maintaining ultra-low latency in SAR scenarios.",2025-10-20 20:22:00+00:00,2025-10-20 20:22:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18084v1
"CourtGuard: A Local, Multiagent Prompt Injection Classifier","As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a ""defense attorney"" model argues the prompt is benign, a ""prosecution attorney"" model argues the prompt is a prompt injection, and a ""judge"" model gives the final classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.",2025-10-20 20:10:06+00:00,2025-10-20 20:10:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19844v1
BadScientist: Can a Research Agent Write Convincing but Unsound Papers that Fool LLM Reviewers?,"The convergence of LLM-powered research assistants and AI-based peer review systems creates a critical vulnerability: fully automated publication loops where AI-generated research is evaluated by AI reviewers without human oversight. We investigate this through \textbf{BadScientist}, a framework that evaluates whether fabrication-oriented paper generation agents can deceive multi-model LLM review systems. Our generator employs presentation-manipulation strategies requiring no real experiments. We develop a rigorous evaluation framework with formal error guarantees (concentration bounds and calibration analysis), calibrated on real data. Our results reveal systematic vulnerabilities: fabricated papers achieve acceptance rates up to . Critically, we identify \textit{concern-acceptance conflict} -- reviewers frequently flag integrity issues yet assign acceptance-level scores. Our mitigation strategies show only marginal improvements, with detection accuracy barely exceeding random chance. Despite provably sound aggregation mathematics, integrity checking systematically fails, exposing fundamental limitations in current AI-driven review systems and underscoring the urgent need for defense-in-depth safeguards in scientific publishing.",2025-10-20 18:37:11+00:00,2025-10-20 18:37:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18003v1
VERA-V: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.",2025-10-20 17:12:10+00:00,2025-10-20 17:12:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17759v1
CrossGuard: Safeguarding MLLMs against Joint-Modal Implicit Malicious Attacks,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong reasoning and perception capabilities but are increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While existing work focuses on explicit attacks, where malicious content resides in a single modality, recent studies reveal implicit attacks, in which benign text and image inputs jointly express unsafe intent. Such joint-modal threats are difficult to detect and remain underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality implicit data. We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on this dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard providing robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit threats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and explicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that CrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced MLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high utility. This offers a balanced and practical solution for enhancing MLLM robustness against real-world multimodal threats.",2025-10-20 16:02:34+00:00,2025-10-20 16:02:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17687v1
SARSteer: Safeguarding Large Audio Language Models via Safe-Ablated Refusal Steering,"Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are becoming essential as a powerful multimodal backbone for real-world applications. However, recent studies show that audio inputs can more easily elicit harmful responses than text, exposing new risks toward deployment. While safety alignment has made initial advances in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), we find that vanilla adaptation of these approaches to LALMs faces two key limitations: 1) LLM-based steering fails under audio input due to the large distributional gap between activations, and 2) prompt-based defenses induce over-refusals on benign-speech queries. To address these challenges, we propose Safe-Ablated Refusal Steering (SARSteer), the first inference-time defense framework for LALMs. Specifically, SARSteer leverages text-derived refusal steering to enforce rejection without manipulating audio inputs and introduces decomposed safe-space ablation to mitigate over-refusal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARSteer significantly improves harmful-query refusal while preserving benign responses, establishing a principled step toward safety alignment in LALMs.",2025-10-20 15:14:25+00:00,2025-10-20 15:14:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17633v1
GUIDE: Enhancing Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning with Denoising Models,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.",2025-10-23 09:28:35+00:00,2025-10-20 15:04:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17621v2
Cybersecurity AI: Evaluating Agentic Cybersecurity in Attack/Defense CTFs,"We empirically evaluate whether AI systems are more effective at attacking or defending in cybersecurity. Using CAI (Cybersecurity AI)'s parallel execution framework, we deployed autonomous agents in 23 Attack/Defense CTF battlegrounds. Statistical analysis reveals defensive agents achieve 54.3% unconstrained patching success versus 28.3% offensive initial access (p=0.0193), but this advantage disappears under operational constraints: when defense requires maintaining availability (23.9%) and preventing all intrusions (15.2%), no significant difference exists (p>0.05). Exploratory taxonomy analysis suggests potential patterns in vulnerability exploitation, though limited sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. This study provides the first controlled empirical evidence challenging claims of AI attacker advantage, demonstrating that defensive effectiveness critically depends on success criteria, a nuance absent from conceptual analyses but essential for deployment. These findings underscore the urgency for defenders to adopt open-source Cybersecurity AI frameworks to maintain security equilibrium against accelerating offensive automation.",2025-10-20 13:21:09+00:00,2025-10-20 13:21:09+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17521v1
Process Automation Architecture Using RFID for Transparent Voting Systems,"This paper presents the development of a process automation architecture leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for secure, transparent and efficient voting systems. The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful verification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote, which is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or transmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism records each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring auditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization mechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored. System testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication accuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and robustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The integration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables electoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate system integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable, automation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced transparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in environments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically needed.",2025-10-20 10:43:51+00:00,2025-10-20 10:43:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17403v1
The Hidden Dangers of Public Serverless Repositories: An Empirical Security Assessment,"Serverless computing has rapidly emerged as a prominent cloud paradigm, enabling developers to focus solely on application logic without the burden of managing servers or underlying infrastructure. Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains largely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security landscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse 2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular among developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates across three widely used IaC frameworks. Our analysis reveals systemic vulnerabilities including outdated software packages, misuse of sensitive parameters, exploitable deployment configurations, susceptibility to typo-squatting attacks and opportunities to embed malicious behaviour within compressed serverless components. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to mitigate these threats.",2025-10-20 08:54:31+00:00,2025-10-20 08:54:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17311v1
Single-Shuffle Full-Open Card-Based Protocols for Any Function,"A card-based secure computation protocol is a method for $n$ parties to compute a function $f$ on their private inputs $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ using physical playing cards, in such a way that the suits of revealed cards leak no information beyond the value of $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. A \textit{single-shuffle full-open} protocol is a minimal model of card-based secure computation in which, after the parties place face-down cards representing their inputs, a single shuffle operation is performed and then all cards are opened to derive the output. Despite the simplicity of this model, the class of functions known to admit single-shuffle full-open protocols has been limited to a few small examples. In this work, we prove for the first time that every function admits a single-shuffle full-open protocol. We present two constructions that offer a trade-off between the number of cards and the complexity of the shuffle operation. These feasibility results are derived from a novel connection between single-shuffle full-open protocols and a cryptographic primitive known as \textit{Private Simultaneous Messages} protocols, which has rarely been studied in the context of card-based cryptography. We also present variants of single-shuffle protocols in which only a subset of cards are revealed. These protocols reduce the complexity of the shuffle operation compared to existing protocols in the same setting.",2025-10-20 08:52:23+00:00,2025-10-20 08:52:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17308v1
Analysis of Input-Output Mappings in Coinjoin Transactions with Arbitrary Values,"A coinjoin protocol aims to increase transactional privacy for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like blockchains via collaborative transactions, by violating assumptions behind common analysis heuristics. Estimating the resulting privacy gain is a crucial yet unsolved problem due to a range of influencing factors and large computational complexity.   We adapt the BlockSci on-chain analysis software to coinjoin transactions, demonstrating a significant (10-50%) average post-mix anonymity set size decrease for all three major designs with a central coordinator: Whirlpool, Wasabi 1.x, and Wasabi 2.x. The decrease is highest during the first day and negligible after one year from a coinjoin creation.   Moreover, we design a precise, parallelizable privacy estimation method, which takes into account coinjoin fees, implementation-specific limitations and users' post-mix behavior. We evaluate our method in detail on a set of emulated and real-world Wasabi 2.x coinjoins and extrapolate to its largest real-world coinjoins with hundreds of inputs and outputs. We conclude that despite the users' undesirable post-mix behavior, correctly attributing the coins to their owners is still very difficult, even with our improved analysis algorithm.",2025-10-20 08:17:25+00:00,2025-10-20 08:17:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17284v1
Breaking and Fixing Defenses Against Control-Flow Hijacking in Multi-Agent Systems,"Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure that all agent invocations are ""related to"" and ""likely to further"" the original objective.   We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle definitions of ""alignment"" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the execution context.   We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve (1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2) enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.",2025-10-20 08:02:51+00:00,2025-10-20 08:02:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17276v1
Can Transformer Memory Be Corrupted? Investigating Cache-Side Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models,"Even when prompts and parameters are secured, transformer language models remain vulnerable because their key-value (KV) cache during inference constitutes an overlooked attack surface. This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.",2025-10-20 02:04:18+00:00,2025-10-20 02:04:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17098v1
Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection,"Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks. Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.",2025-10-20 02:00:12+00:00,2025-10-20 02:00:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17917v1
Watermark Robustness and Radioactivity May Be at Odds in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across distributed data sources. As these sources increasingly include LLM-generated text, provenance tracking becomes essential for accountability and transparency. We adapt LLM watermarking for data provenance in FL where a subset of clients compute local updates on watermarked data, and the server averages all updates into the global LLM. In this setup, watermarks are radioactive: the watermark signal remains detectable after fine-tuning with high confidence. The $p$-value can reach $10^{-24}$ even when as little as $6.6\%$ of data is watermarked. However, the server can act as an active adversary that wants to preserve model utility while evading provenance tracking. Our observation is that updates induced by watermarked synthetic data appear as outliers relative to non-watermark updates. Our adversary thus applies strong robust aggregation that can filter these outliers, together with the watermark signal. All evaluated radioactive watermarks are not robust against such an active filtering server. Our work suggests fundamental trade-offs between radioactivity, robustness, and utility.",2025-10-19 22:39:29+00:00,2025-10-19 22:39:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17033v1
Bits Leaked per Query: Information-Theoretic Bounds on Adversarial Attacks against LLMs,"Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$ that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.",2025-10-19 20:51:24+00:00,2025-10-19 20:51:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17000v1
Deterministic Hardness of Approximation of Unique-SVP and GapSVP in $\ell_p$ norms for $p>2$,"We establish deterministic hardness of approximation results for the Shortest Vector Problem in $\ell_p$ norm ($\mathsf{SVP}_p$) and for Unique-SVP ($\mathsf{uSVP}_p$) for all $p > 2$. Previously, no deterministic hardness results were known, except for $\ell_\infty$.   For every $p > 2$, we prove constant-ratio hardness: no polynomial-time algorithm approximates $\mathsf{SVP}_p$ or $\mathsf{uSVP}_p$ within a ratio of $\sqrt{2} - o(1)$, assuming $\textsf{3SAT} \notin \text{DTIME}(2^{O(n^{2/3}\log n)})$, and, $\textsf{Unambiguous-3SAT} \notin \text{DTIME}(2^{O(n^{2/3}\log n)})$.   We also show that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $p_\varepsilon > 2$ such that for every $p \ge p_\varepsilon$: no polynomial-time algorithm approximates $\mathsf{SVP}_p$ within a ratio of $2^{(\log n)^{1- \varepsilon}}$, assuming $\text{NP} \nsubseteq \text{DTIME}(n^{(\log n)^\varepsilon})$; and within a ratio of $n^{1/(\log\log(n))^\varepsilon}$, assuming $\text{NP} \nsubseteq \text{SUBEXP}$. This improves upon [Haviv, Regev, Theory of Computing 2012], which obtained similar inapproximation ratios under randomized reductions. We obtain analogous results for $\mathsf{uSVP}_p$ under the assumptions $\textsf{Unambiguous-3SAT} \not\subseteq \text{DTIME}(n^{(\log n)^\varepsilon})$ and $\textsf{Unambiguous-3SAT} \not\subseteq \text{SUBEXP}$, improving the previously known $1+o(1)$ [Stephens-Davidowitz, Approx 2016].   Strengthening the hardness of $\textsf{uSVP}$ has direct cryptographic impact. By the reduction of Lyubashevsky and Micciancio [Lyubashevsky, Micciancio, CRYPTO 2009], hardness for $γ$-$\mathsf{uSVP}_p$ carries over to ${\frac{1}γ}$-$\mathsf{BDD}_p$ (Bounded Distance Decoding). Thus, understanding the hardness of $\textsf{uSVP}$ improves worst-case guarantees for two core problems that underpin security in lattice-based cryptography.",2025-10-19 20:17:26+00:00,2025-10-19 20:17:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16991v1
Efficient derandomization of differentially private counting queries,"Differential privacy for the 2020 census required an estimated 90 terabytes of randomness [GL20], an amount which may be prohibitively expensive or entirely infeasible to generate. Motivated by these practical concerns, [CSV25] initiated the study of the randomness complexity of differential privacy, and in particular, the randomness complexity of $d$ counting queries. This is the task of outputting the number of entries in a dataset that satisfy predicates $\mathcal{P}_1, \dots, \mathcal{P}_d$ respectively. They showed the rather surprising fact that though any reasonably accurate, $\varepsilon$-differentially private mechanism for one counting query requires $1-O(\varepsilon)$ bits of randomness in expectation, there exists a fairly accurate mechanism for $d$ counting queries which requires only $O(\log d)$ bits of randomness in expectation.   The mechanism of [CSV25] is inefficient (not polynomial time) and relies on a combinatorial object known as rounding schemes. Here, we give a polynomial time mechanism which achieves nearly the same randomness complexity versus accuracy tradeoff as that of [CSV25]. Our construction is based on the following simple observation: after a randomized shift of the answer to each counting query, the answer to many counting queries remains the same regardless of whether we add noise to that coordinate or not. This allows us to forgo the step of adding noise to the result of many counting queries. Our mechanism does not make use of rounding schemes. Therefore, it provides a different -- and, in our opinion, clearer -- insight into the origins of the randomness savings that can be obtained by batching $d$ counting queries.",2025-10-21 08:25:19+00:00,2025-10-19 19:00:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16959v2
UNDREAM: Bridging Differentiable Rendering and Photorealistic Simulation for End-to-end Adversarial Attacks,"Deep learning models deployed in safety critical applications like autonomous driving use simulations to test their robustness against adversarial attacks in realistic conditions. However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.",2025-10-27 17:59:01+00:00,2025-10-19 16:38:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16923v2
Addendum: Systematic Evaluation of Randomized Cache Designs against Cache Occupancy,"In the main text published at USENIX Security 2025, we presented a systematic analysis of the role of cache occupancy in the design considerations for randomized caches (from the perspectives of performance and security). On the performance front, we presented a uniform benchmarking strategy that allows for a fair comparison among different randomized cache designs. Likewise, from the security perspective, we presented three threat assumptions: (1) covert channels; (2) process fingerprinting side-channel; and (3) AES key recovery. The main takeaway of our work is an open problem of designing a randomized cache of comparable efficiency with modern set-associative LLCs, while still resisting both contention-based and occupancy-based attacks. This note is meant as an addendum to the main text in light of the observations made in [2]. To summarize, the authors in [2] argue that (1) L1d cache size plays a role in adversarial success, and that (2) a patched version of MIRAGE with randomized initial seeding of global eviction map prevents leakage of AES key. We discuss the same in this addendum.",2025-10-19 15:13:25+00:00,2025-10-19 15:13:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16871v1
Verifiable Fine-Tuning for LLMs: Zero-Knowledge Training Proofs Bound to Data Provenance and Policy,"Large language models are often adapted through parameter efficient fine tuning, but current release practices provide weak assurances about what data were used and how updates were computed. We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a protocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a released model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared training program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines five elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing, licenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable sampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch selection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning that enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations with explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step proofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond verification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property cards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual instruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while achieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero violations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage. Federated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic audits and bandwidth constraints. These results indicate that end to end verifiable fine tuning is feasible today for real parameter efficient pipelines, closing a critical trust gap for regulated and decentralized deployments.",2025-11-10 08:02:49+00:00,2025-10-19 13:33:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16830v2
Black-box Optimization of LLM Outputs by Asking for Directions,"We present a novel approach for attacking black-box large language models (LLMs) by exploiting their ability to express confidence in natural language. Existing black-box attacks require either access to continuous model outputs like logits or confidence scores (which are rarely available in practice), or rely on proxy signals from other models. Instead, we demonstrate how to prompt LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently calibrated to enable effective adversarial optimization. We apply our general method to three attack scenarios: adversarial examples for vision-LLMs, jailbreaks and prompt injections. Our attacks successfully generate malicious inputs against systems that only expose textual outputs, thereby dramatically expanding the attack surface for deployed LLMs. We further find that better and larger models exhibit superior calibration when expressing confidence, creating a concerning security paradox where model capability improvements directly enhance vulnerability. Our code is available at this [link](https://github.com/zj-jayzhang/black_box_llm_optimization).",2025-10-19 11:13:45+00:00,2025-10-19 11:13:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16794v1
Cryptanalysis of a Privacy-Preserving Ride-Hailing Service from NSS 2022,"Ride-Hailing Services (RHS) match a ride request initiated by a rider with a suitable driver responding to the ride request. A Privacy-Preserving RHS (PP-RHS) aims to facilitate ride matching while ensuring the privacy of riders' and drivers' location data w.r.t. the Service Provider (SP). At NSS 2022, Xie et al. proposed a PP-RHS. In this work, we demonstrate a passive attack on their PP-RHS protocol. Our attack allows the SP to completely recover the locations of the rider as well as that of the responding drivers in every ride request. Further, our attack is very efficient as it is independent of the security parameter.",2025-10-19 08:05:25+00:00,2025-10-19 08:05:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16744v1
CLIP: Client-Side Invariant Pruning for Mitigating Stragglers in Secure Federated Learning,"Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13% to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.",2025-10-19 03:29:37+00:00,2025-10-19 03:29:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16694v1
A Versatile Framework for Designing Group-Sparse Adversarial Attacks,"Existing adversarial attacks often neglect perturbation sparsity, limiting their ability to model structural changes and to explain how deep neural networks (DNNs) process meaningful input patterns. We propose ATOS (Attack Through Overlapping Sparsity), a differentiable optimization framework that generates structured, sparse adversarial perturbations in element-wise, pixel-wise, and group-wise forms. For white-box attacks on image classifiers, we introduce the Overlapping Smoothed L0 (OSL0) function, which promotes convergence to a stationary point while encouraging sparse, structured perturbations. By grouping channels and adjacent pixels, ATOS improves interpretability and helps identify robust versus non-robust features. We approximate the L-infinity gradient using the logarithm of the sum of exponential absolute values to tightly control perturbation magnitude. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, ATOS achieves a 100% attack success rate while producing significantly sparser and more structurally coherent perturbations than prior methods. The structured group-wise attack highlights critical regions from the network's perspective, providing counterfactual explanations by replacing class-defining regions with robust features from the target class.",2025-10-18 20:42:45+00:00,2025-10-18 20:42:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16637v1
Toward Understanding Security Issues in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that enables AI-powered applications to interact with external tools through structured metadata. A rapidly growing ecosystem has formed around MCP, including a wide range of MCP hosts (i.e., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and Cline), MCP registries (i.e., mcp.so, MCP Market, MCP Store, Pulse MCP, Smithery, and npm), and thousands of community-contributed MCP servers. Although the MCP ecosystem is gaining traction, there has been little systematic study of its architecture and associated security risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of the MCP ecosystem. We decompose MCP ecosystem into three core components: hosts, registries, and servers, and study the interactions and trust relationships among them. Users search for servers on registries and configure them in the host, which translates LLM-generated output into external tool invocations provided by the servers and executes them. Our qualitative analysis reveals that hosts lack output verification mechanisms for LLM-generated outputs, enabling malicious servers to manipulate model behavior and induce a variety of security threats, including but not limited to sensitive data exfiltration. We uncover a wide range of vulnerabilities that enable attackers to hijack servers, due to the lack of a vetted server submission process in registries. To support our analysis, we collect and analyze a dataset of 67,057 servers from six public registries. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that a substantial number of servers can be hijacked by attackers. Finally, we propose practical defense strategies for MCP hosts, registries, and users. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected hosts and registries.",2025-10-18 16:09:05+00:00,2025-10-18 16:09:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16558v1

The task required designing an adversarial attack against a provided classification model that maximizes misclassification while minimizing perturbations. Our approach employs a multi-round gradient-based strategy that leverages the differentiable structure of the model, augmented with random initialization and sample-mixing techniques to enhance effectiveness.

Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Binary Dot Product via Multi-Party Computation,"Striking a balance between protecting data privacy and enabling collaborative computation is a critical challenge for distributed machine learning. While privacy-preserving techniques for federated learning have been extensively developed, methods for scenarios involving bitwise operations, such as tree-based vertical federated learning (VFL), are still underexplored. Traditional mechanisms, including Shamir's secret sharing and multi-party computation (MPC), are not optimized for bitwise operations over binary data, particularly in settings where each participant holds a different part of the binary vector. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by proposing a novel binary multi-party computation (BiMPC) framework. The BiMPC mechanism facilitates privacy-preserving bitwise operations, with a particular focus on dot product computations of binary vectors, ensuring the privacy of each individual bit. The core of BiMPC is a novel approach called Dot Product via Modular Addition (DoMA), which uses regular and modular additions for efficient binary dot product calculation. To ensure privacy, BiMPC uses random masking in a higher field for linear computations and a three-party oblivious transfer (triot) protocol for non-linear binary operations. The privacy guarantees of the BiMPC framework are rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability in distributed settings.",2025-10-18 03:35:42+00:00,2025-10-18 03:35:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16331v1
When Intelligence Fails: An Empirical Study on Why LLMs Struggle with Password Cracking,"The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation have sparked interest in their potential for cybersecurity applications, including password guessing. In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation into the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs for password cracking using synthetic user profiles. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA, Falcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords based on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our results, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext and SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all models achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional rule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly higher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify key limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the domain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite their linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and memorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially in the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This study provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial contexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure, privacy-preserving, and robust password modeling.",2025-10-26 07:40:35+00:00,2025-10-18 02:15:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17884v2
"From Flows to Words: Can Zero-/Few-Shot LLMs Detect Network Intrusions? A Grammar-Constrained, Calibrated Evaluation on UNSW-NB15","Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason over natural-language inputs, but their role in intrusion detection without fine-tuning remains uncertain. This study evaluates a prompt-only approach on UNSW-NB15 by converting each network flow to a compact textual record and augmenting it with lightweight, domain-inspired boolean flags (asymmetry, burst rate, TTL irregularities, timer anomalies, rare service/state, short bursts). To reduce output drift and support measurement, the model is constrained to produce structured, grammar-valid responses, and a single decision threshold is calibrated on a small development split. We compare zero-shot, instruction-guided, and few-shot prompting to strong tabular and neural baselines under identical splits, reporting accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and macro scores. Empirically, unguided prompting is unreliable, while instructions plus flags substantially improve detection quality; adding calibrated scoring further stabilizes results. On a balanced subset of two hundred flows, a 7B instruction-tuned model with flags reaches macro-F1 near 0.78; a lighter 3B model with few-shot cues and calibration attains F1 near 0.68 on one thousand examples. As the evaluation set grows to two thousand flows, decision quality decreases, revealing sensitivity to coverage and prompting. Tabular baselines remain more stable and faster, yet the prompt-only pipeline requires no gradient training, produces readable artifacts, and adapts easily through instructions and flags. Contributions include a flow-to-text protocol with interpretable cues, a calibration method for thresholding, a systematic baseline comparison, and a reproducibility bundle with prompts, grammar, metrics, and figures.",2025-10-26 07:42:39+00:00,2025-10-18 02:11:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17883v2
C/N0 Analysis-Based GPS Spoofing Detection with Variable Antenna Orientations,"GPS spoofing poses a growing threat to aviation by falsifying satellite signals and misleading aircraft navigation systems. This paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept spoofing detection strategy based on analyzing satellite Carrier-to-Noise Density Ratio (C/N$_0$) variation during controlled static antenna orientations. Using a u-blox EVK-M8U receiver and a GPSG-1000 satellite simulator, C/N$_0$ data is collected under three antenna orientations flat, banked right, and banked left) in both real-sky (non-spoofed) and spoofed environments. Our findings reveal that under non-spoofed signals, C/N$_0$ values fluctuate naturally with orientation, reflecting true geometric dependencies. However, spoofed signals demonstrate a distinct pattern: the flat orientation, which directly faces the spoofing antenna, consistently yielded the highest C/N$_0$ values, while both banked orientations showed reduced C/N$_0$ due to misalignment with the spoofing source. These findings suggest that simple maneuvers such as brief banking to induce C/N$_0$ variations can provide early cues of GPS spoofing for general aviation and UAV systems.",2025-10-17 21:40:58+00:00,2025-10-17 21:40:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16229v1
SentinelNet: Safeguarding Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Credit-Based Dynamic Threat Detection,"Malicious agents pose significant threats to the reliability and decision-making capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.",2025-10-21 12:58:13+00:00,2025-10-17 21:10:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16219v2
Prompt injections as a tool for preserving identity in GAI image descriptions,"Generative AI risks such as bias and lack of representation impact people who do not interact directly with GAI systems, but whose content does: indirect users. Several approaches to mitigating harms to indirect users have been described, but most require top down or external intervention. An emerging strategy, prompt injections, provides an empowering alternative: indirect users can mitigate harm against them, from within their own content. Our approach proposes prompt injections not as a malicious attack vector, but as a tool for content/image owner resistance. In this poster, we demonstrate one case study of prompt injections for empowering an indirect user, by retaining an image owner's gender and disabled identity when an image is described by GAI.",2025-10-17 18:11:07+00:00,2025-10-17 18:11:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16128v1
Towards Proactive Defense Against Cyber Cognitive Attacks,"Cyber cognitive attacks leverage disruptive innovations (DIs) to exploit psychological biases and manipulate decision-making processes. Emerging technologies, such as AI-driven disinformation and synthetic media, have accelerated the scale and sophistication of these threats. Prior studies primarily categorize current cognitive attack tactics, lacking predictive mechanisms to anticipate future DIs and their malicious use in cognitive attacks. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel predictive methodology for forecasting the emergence of DIs and their malicious uses in cognitive attacks. We identify trends in adversarial tactics and propose proactive defense strategies.",2025-10-17 16:25:47+00:00,2025-10-17 16:25:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15801v1
Towards a Blockchain-Based CI/CD Framework to Enhance Security in Cloud Environments,"Security is becoming a pivotal point in cloud platforms. Several divisions, such as business organisations, health care, government, etc., have experienced cyber-attacks on their infrastructures. This research focuses on security issues within Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in a cloud platform as a reaction to recent cyber breaches. This research proposes a blockchain-based solution to enhance CI/CD pipeline security. This research aims to develop a framework that leverages blockchain's distributed ledger technology and tamper-resistant features to improve CI/CD pipeline security. The goal is to emphasise secure software deployment by integrating threat modelling frameworks and adherence to coding standards. It also aims to employ tools to automate security testing to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and flaws, such as an outdated version of Java Spring Framework, a JavaScript library from an unverified source, or a database library that allows SQL injection attacks in the deployed software through the framework.",2025-10-17 15:41:40+00:00,2025-10-17 15:41:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16087v1
PassREfinder-FL: Privacy-Preserving Credential Stuffing Risk Prediction via Graph-Based Federated Learning for Representing Password Reuse between Websites,"Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.",2025-10-17 14:59:24+00:00,2025-10-17 14:59:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16083v1
MalCVE: Malware Detection and CVE Association Using Large Language Models,"Malicious software attacks are having an increasingly significant economic impact. Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and utilizes the capabilities of LLMs combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool called MalCVE, which integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and CVE classification using LLMs. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. It is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.",2025-10-17 11:55:46+00:00,2025-10-17 11:55:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15567v1
ISO/IEC-Compliant Match-on-Card Face Verification with Short Binary Templates,"We present a practical match-on-card design for face verification in which compact 64/128-bit templates are produced off-card by PCA-ITQ and compared on-card via constant-time Hamming distance. We specify ISO/IEC 7816-4 and 14443-4 command APDUs with fixed-length payloads and decision-only status words (no score leakage), together with a minimal per-identity EEPROM map. Using real binary codes from a CelebA working set (55 identities, 412 images), we (i) derive operating thresholds from ROC/DET, (ii) replay enroll->verify transactions at those thresholds, and (iii) bound end-to-end time by pure link latency plus a small constant on-card budget. Even at the slowest contact rate (9.6 kbps), total verification time is 43.9 ms (64 b) and 52.3 ms (128 b); at 38.4 kbps both are <14 ms. At FAR = 1%, both code lengths reach TPR = 0.836, while 128 b lowers EER relative to 64 b. An optional +6 B helper (targeted symbol-level parity over empirically unstable bits) is latency-negligible. Overall, short binary templates, fixed-payload decision-only APDUs, and constant-time matching satisfy ISO/IEC transport constraints with wide timing margin and align with ISO/IEC 24745 privacy goals. Limitations: single-dataset evaluation and design-level (pre-hardware) timing; we outline AgeDB/CFP-FP and on-card microbenchmarks as next steps.",2025-10-17 11:42:56+00:00,2025-10-17 11:42:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16078v1
High Memory Masked Convolutional Codes for PQC,"This paper presents a novel post-quantum cryptosystem based on high-memory masked convolutional codes. Unlike conventional code-based schemes that rely on block codes with fixed dimensions and limited error-correction capability, our construction offers both stronger cryptographic security and greater flexibility. It supports arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless scalability to long messages. Security is reinforced through a higher-rate injection of random errors than in block-code approaches, along with additional noise introduced via polynomial division, which substantially obfuscates the underlying code structure. Semi-invertible transformations generate dense, random-like generator matrices that conceal algebraic properties and resist known structural attacks. Consequently, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic security margins exceeding those of the classic McEliece system by factors greater than 2100. Finally, decryption at the recipient employs an array of parallel Viterbi decoders, enabling efficient hardware and software implementation and positioning the scheme as a strong candidate for deployment in practical quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems.",2025-10-17 10:39:20+00:00,2025-10-17 10:39:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15515v1
SoK: Taxonomy and Evaluation of Prompt Security in Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to real-world applications, powering services across diverse sectors. However, their widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs. Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1) proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses, and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation; (3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date;\footnote{The dataset is released at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/youbin2014/JailbreakDB}{\textcolor{purple}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/youbin2014/JailbreakDB}}.} and (5) presenting a comprehensive evaluation platform and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods \footnote{will be released soon.}.

FHE-SQL: Fully Homomorphic Encrypted SQL Database,"FHE-SQL is a privacy-preserving database system that enables secure query processing on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), providing privacy guaranties where an untrusted server can execute encrypted queries without learning either the query contents or the underlying data. Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels. Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware, type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks, multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the Universal Composability framework.",2025-10-17 08:07:27+00:00,2025-10-17 08:07:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15413v1
OCR-APT: Reconstructing APT Stories from Audit Logs using Subgraph Anomaly Detection and LLMs,"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.",2025-10-20 12:03:37+00:00,2025-10-16 23:14:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15188v2
PoTS: Proof-of-Training-Steps for Backdoor Detection in Large Language Models,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across critical domains, ensuring secure and trustworthy training processes has become a major concern. Backdoor attacks, where malicious actors inject hidden triggers into training data, are particularly insidious and difficult to detect. Existing post-training verification solutions like Proof-of-Learning are impractical for LLMs due to their requirement for full retraining, lack of robustness against stealthy manipulations, and inability to provide early detection during training. Early detection would significantly reduce computational costs. To address these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification protocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM developer (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data batches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the LLMs' language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can expose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training. Even with backdoor triggers in up to 10 percent of the training data, our protocol significantly reduces the attacker's ability to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). Our method enables early detection of attacks at the injection step, with verification steps being 3x faster than training steps. Our results highlight the protocol's potential to enhance the accountability and security of LLM development, especially against insider threats.",2025-10-16 19:49:34+00:00,2025-10-16 19:49:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15106v1
PrivacyPAD: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Privacy-Aware Delegation,"When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can often contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a powerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance and risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data privacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior approaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which shatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive information, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge (Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to solve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks, learning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage and task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and task-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal utility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a new medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity of learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.",2025-10-16 19:38:36+00:00,2025-10-16 19:38:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16054v1
Sequential Comics for Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Structured Visual Storytelling,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.",2025-10-16 18:30:26+00:00,2025-10-16 18:30:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15068v1
A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems,"Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.",2025-10-16 17:24:18+00:00,2025-10-16 17:24:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1
Provable Unlearning with Gradient Ascent on Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks,"Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models, addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch. Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(ε, δ, τ)$-successful} unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic Gaussian-mixture setting.",2025-10-16 16:16:36+00:00,2025-10-16 16:16:36+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14844v1
ColumnDisturb: Understanding Column-based Read Disturbance in Real DRAM Chips and Implications for Future Systems,"We experimentally demonstrate a new widespread read disturbance phenomenon, ColumnDisturb, in real commodity DRAM chips. By repeatedly opening or keeping a DRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM cells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells sharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays). With ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells across as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to RowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor row in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its characteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2 chips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental observations, we highlight two major results and their implications.   First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and worsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum time to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We observe that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a standard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict that, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in future DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh window. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows than retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for retention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell retention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces the benefits of such mechanisms.",2025-10-17 09:37:37+00:00,2025-10-16 14:52:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14750v2
SLIE: A Secure and Lightweight Cryptosystem for Data Sharing in IoT Healthcare Services,"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized healthcare by transforming medical operations into standardized, interoperable services. However, this service-oriented model introduces significant security vulnerabilities in device management and communication, which are especially critical given the sensitivity of medical data. To address these risks, this paper proposes SLIE (Secure and Lightweight Identity Encryption), a novel cryptosystem based on Wildcard Key Derivation Identity-Based Encryption (WKD-IBE). SLIE ensures scalable trust and secure omnidirectional communication through end-to-end encryption, hierarchical access control, and a lightweight key management system designed for resource-constrained devices. It incorporates constant-time operations, memory obfuscation, and expiry-based key revocation to counter side-channel, man-in-the-middle, and unauthorized access attacks, thereby ensuring compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR. Evaluations show that SLIE significantly outperforms RSA, with encryption and decryption times of 0.936ms and 0.217ms for 1KB of data, an 84.54% improvement in encryption speed, a 99.70% improvement in decryption speed, and an energy efficiency of 0.014 J/KB.",2025-10-16 14:10:48+00:00,2025-10-16 14:10:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14708v1
FibRace: a large-scale benchmark of client-side proving on mobile devices,"FibRace, jointly developed by KKRT Labs and Hyli, was the first large-scale experiment to test client-side proof generation on smartphones using Cairo M. Presented as a mobile game in which players proved Fibonacci numbers and climbed a leaderboard, FibRace served a dual purpose: to engage the public and to provide empirical benchmarking. Over a three-week campaign (September 11-30, 2025), 6,047 players across 99 countries generated 2,195,488 proofs on 1,420 unique device models. The results show that most modern smartphones can complete a proof in under 5 seconds, confirming that *mobile devices are now capable of producing zero-knowledge proofs reliably*, without the need for remote provers or specialized hardware. Performance was correlated primarily with RAM capacity and SoC (System on Chip) performance: devices with at least 3 GB of RAM proved stably, when Apple's A19 Pro and M-series chips achieved the fastest proving times. Hyli's blockchain natively verified every proof onchain without congestion. FibRace provides the most comprehensive dataset to date on mobile proving performance, establishing a practical baseline for future research in lightweight provers, proof-powered infrastructure, and privacy-preserving mobile applications.",2025-10-16 13:59:00+00:00,2025-10-16 13:59:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14693v1
AEX-NStep: Probabilistic Interrupt Counting Attacks on Intel SGX,"To mitigate interrupt-based stepping attacks (notably using SGX-Step), Intel introduced AEX-Notify, an ISA extension to Intel SGX that aims to prevent deterministic single-stepping. In this work, we introduce AEX-NStep, the first interrupt counting attack on AEX-Notify-enabled Enclaves. We show that deterministic single-stepping is not required for interrupt counting attacks to be practical and that, therefore, AEX-Notify does not entirely prevent such attacks. We specifically show that one of AEX-Notify's security guarantees, obfuscated forward progress, does not hold, and we introduce two new probabilistic interrupt counting attacks. We use these attacks to construct a practical ECDSA key leakage attack on an AEX-Notify-enabled SGX enclave. Our results extend the original security analysis of AEX-Notify and inform the design of future mitigations.",2025-10-16 13:31:04+00:00,2025-10-16 13:31:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14675v1
Improving Cybercrime Detection and Digital Forensics Investigations with Artificial Intelligence,"According to a recent EUROPOL report, cybercrime is still recurrent in Europe, and different activities and countermeasures must be taken to limit, prevent, detect, analyze, and fight it. Cybercrime must be prevented with specific measures, tools, and techniques, for example through automated network and malware analysis. Countermeasures against cybercrime can also be improved with proper \df analysis in order to extract data from digital devices trying to retrieve information on the cybercriminals. Indeed, results obtained through a proper \df analysis can be leveraged to train cybercrime detection systems to prevent the success of similar crimes. Nowadays, some systems have started to adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for cyberattack detection and \df analysis improvement. However, AI can be better applied as an additional instrument in these systems to improve the detection and in the \df analysis. For this reason, we highlight how cybercrime analysis and \df procedures can take advantage of AI. On the other hand, cybercriminals can use these systems to improve their skills, bypass automatic detection, and develop advanced attack techniques. The case study we presented highlights how it is possible to integrate the use of the three popular chatbots {\tt Gemini}, {\tt Copilot} and {\tt chatGPT} to develop a Python code to encode and decoded images with steganographic technique, even though their presence is not an indicator of crime, attack or maliciousness but used by a cybercriminal as anti-forensics technique.",2025-10-16 12:53:36+00:00,2025-10-16 12:53:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14638v1
Symbolic verification of Apple's Find My location-tracking protocol,"Tracking devices, while designed to help users find their belongings in case of loss/theft, bring in new questions about privacy and surveillance of not just their own users, but in the case of crowd-sourced location tracking, even that of others even orthogonally associated with these platforms. Apple's Find My is perhaps the most ubiquitous such system which can even locate devices which do not possess any cellular support or GPS, running on millions of devices worldwide. Apple claims that this system is private and secure, but the code is proprietary, and such claims have to be taken on faith. It is well known that even with perfect cryptographic guarantees, logical flaws might creep into protocols, and allow undesirable attacks. In this paper, we present a symbolic model of the Find My protocol, as well as a precise formal specification of desirable properties, and provide automated, machine-checkable proofs of these properties in the Tamarin prover.",2025-10-21 10:04:23+00:00,2025-10-16 11:52:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14589v2
Lexo: Eliminating Stealthy Supply-Chain Attacks via LLM-Assisted Program Regeneration,"Software supply-chain attacks are an important and ongoing concern in the open source software ecosystem. These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.",2025-10-22 23:13:19+00:00,2025-10-16 10:12:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14522v2
Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers,"Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $Δ$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $Δ$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.",2025-10-16 07:28:54+00:00,2025-10-16 07:28:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381v1
"Terrarium: Revisiting the Blackboard for Multi-Agent Safety, Privacy, and Security Studies","A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems.",2025-10-16 05:19:13+00:00,2025-10-16 05:19:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14312v1
Infrastructure Patterns in Toll Scam Domains: A Comprehensive Analysis of Cybercriminal Registration and Hosting Strategies,"Toll scams involve criminals registering fake domains that pretend to be legitimate transportation agencies to trick users into making fraudulent payments. Although these scams are rapidly increasing and causing significant harm, they have not been extensively studied. We present the first large-scale analysis of toll scam domains, using a newly created dataset of 67,907 confirmed scam domains mostly registered in 2025. Our study reveals that attackers exploit permissive registrars and less common top-level domains, with 86.9% of domains concentrated in just five non-mainstream TLDs and 72.9% registered via a single provider. We also discover specific registration patterns, including short bursts of activity that suggest automated, coordinated attacks, with over half of domains registered in the first quarter of 2025. This extreme temporal clustering reflects highly synchronized campaign launches. Additionally, we build a simple predictive model using only domain registration data to predict which scam domains are likely to be suspended -- a proxy for confirmed abuse -- achieving 80.4% accuracy, and 92.3% sensitivity. Our analysis reveals attacker strategies for evading detection -- such as exploiting obscure TLDs, permissive registrars, and coordinated registration bursts -- which can inform more targeted interventions by registrars, hosting providers, and security platforms. However, our results suggest that registration metadata alone may be insufficient, and incorporating features from domain URLs and webpage content could further improve detection.",2025-10-16 01:09:30+00:00,2025-10-16 01:09:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14198v1

Toward Cybersecurity-Expert Small Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1.

Every Language Model Has a Forgery-Resistant Signature,"The ubiquity of closed-weight language models with public-facing APIs has generated interest in forensic methods, both for extracting hidden model details (e.g., parameters) and for identifying models by their outputs. One successful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric constraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this work, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language model outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a signature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given output. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from existing model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In particular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model parameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities (logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring, since all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the signature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the model inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and redundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the model. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse from small models and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for production-scale models. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a protocol for language model output verification, analogous to cryptographic symmetric-key message authentication systems.",2025-10-15 20:46:38+00:00,2025-10-15 20:46:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14086v1
On-Chain Decentralized Learning and Cost-Effective Inference for DeFi Attack Mitigation,"Billions of dollars are lost every year in DeFi platforms by transactions exploiting business logic or accounting vulnerabilities. Existing defenses focus on static code analysis, public mempool screening, attacker contract detection, or trusted off-chain monitors, none of which prevents exploits submitted through private relays or malicious contracts that execute within the same block. We present the first decentralized, fully on-chain learning framework that: (i) performs gas-prohibitive computation on Layer-2 to reduce cost, (ii) propagates verified model updates to Layer-1, and (iii) enables gas-bounded, low-latency inference inside smart contracts. A novel Proof-of-Improvement (PoIm) protocol governs the training process and verifies each decentralized micro update as a self-verifying training transaction. Updates are accepted by \textit{PoIm} only if they demonstrably improve at least one core metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision, or recall) on a public benchmark without degrading any of the other core metrics, while adversarial proposals get financially penalized through an adaptable test set for evolving threats. We develop quantization and loop-unrolling techniques that enable inference for logistic regression, SVM, MLPs, CNNs, and gated RNNs (with support for formally verified decision tree inference) within the Ethereum block gas limit, while remaining bit-exact to their off-chain counterparts, formally proven in Z3. We curate 298 unique real-world exploits (2020 - 2025) with 402 exploit transactions across eight EVM chains, collectively responsible for \$3.74 B in losses.",2025-10-15 18:58:34+00:00,2025-10-15 18:58:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16024v1
Local Information-Theoretic Security via Euclidean Geometry,"This paper introduces a methodology based on Euclidean information theory to investigate local properties of secure communication over discrete memoryless wiretap channels. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a legitimate user's information rate while imposing explicit upper bounds on both the information leakage to an eavesdropper and the informational cost of encoding the secret message. By leveraging local geometric approximations, this inherently non-convex problem is transformed into a tractable quadratic programming structure. It is demonstrated that the optimal Lagrange multipliers governing this approximated problem can be found by solving a linear program. The constraints of this linear program are derived from Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and are expressed in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of channel-derived matrices. This framework facilitates the derivation of an analytical formula for an approximate local secrecy capacity. Furthermore, we define and analyze a new class of secret local contraction coefficients. These coefficients, characterized as the largest generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil, quantify the maximum achievable ratio of approximate utility to approximate leakage, thus measuring the intrinsic local leakage efficiency of the channel. We establish bounds connecting these local coefficients to their global counterparts defined over true mutual information measures. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through detailed analysis and numerical illustrations for both general multi-mode channels and the canonical binary symmetric wiretap channel.",2025-10-15 15:19:59+00:00,2025-10-15 15:19:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13661v1
How Blind and Low-Vision Users Manage Their Passwords,"Managing passwords securely and conveniently is still an open problem for many users. Existing research has examined users' password management strategies and identified pain points, such as security concerns, leading to insecure practices. We investigate how Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users tackle this problem and how password managers can assist them. This paper presents the results of a qualitative interview study with N = 33 BLV participants. We found that all participants utilize password managers to some extent, which they perceive as fairly accessible. However, the adoption is mainly driven by the convenience of storing and retrieving passwords. The security advantages - generating strong, random passwords - were avoided mainly due to the absence of practical accessibility. Password managers do not adhere to BLV users' underlying needs for agency, which stem from experiences with inaccessible software and vendors who deprioritize accessibility issues. Underutilization of password managers leads BLV users to adopt insecure practices, such as reusing predictable passwords or resorting to 'security through obscurity' by writing important credentials in braille. We conclude our analysis by discussing the need to implement practical accessibility and usability improvements for password managers as a way of establishing trust and secure practices while maintaining BLV users' agency.",2025-10-15 13:33:45+00:00,2025-10-15 13:33:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13538v1
Who Speaks for the Trigger? Dynamic Expert Routing in Backdoored Mixture-of-Experts Transformers,"Large language models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve impressive performance and efficiency by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subnetworks, known as experts. However, this sparse routing mechanism inherently exhibits task preferences due to expert specialization, introducing a new and underexplored vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors into MoE-based LLMs by exploiting their inherent expert routing preferences. We thus propose BadSwitch, a novel backdoor framework that integrates task-coupled dynamic trigger optimization with a sensitivity-guided Top-S expert tracing mechanism. Our approach jointly optimizes trigger embeddings during pretraining while identifying S most sensitive experts, subsequently constraining the Top-K gating mechanism to these targeted experts. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that rely on superficial data poisoning or model editing, BadSwitch primarily embeds malicious triggers into expert routing paths with strong task affinity, enabling precise and stealthy model manipulation. Through comprehensive evaluations across three prominent MoE architectures (Switch Transformer, QwenMoE, and DeepSeekMoE), we demonstrate that BadSwitch can efficiently hijack pre-trained models with up to 100% success rate (ASR) while maintaining the highest clean accuracy (ACC) among all baselines. Furthermore, BadSwitch exhibits strong resilience against both text-level and model-level defense mechanisms, achieving 94.07% ASR and 87.18% ACC on the AGNews dataset. Our analysis of expert activation patterns reveals fundamental insights into MoE vulnerabilities. We anticipate this work will expose security risks in MoE systems and contribute to advancing AI safety.",2025-10-15 12:11:02+00:00,2025-10-15 12:11:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13462v1
Toward Efficient Inference Attacks: Shadow Model Sharing via Mixture-of-Experts,"Machine learning models are often vulnerable to inference attacks that expose sensitive information from their training data. Shadow model technique is commonly employed in such attacks, such as membership inference. However, the need for a large number of shadow models leads to high computational costs, limiting their practical applicability. Such inefficiency mainly stems from the independent training and use of these shadow models. To address this issue, we present a novel shadow pool training framework SHAPOOL, which constructs multiple shared models and trains them jointly within a single process. In particular, we leverage the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism as the shadow pool to interconnect individual models, enabling them to share some sub-networks and thereby improving efficiency. To ensure the shared models closely resemble independent models and serve as effective substitutes, we introduce three novel modules: path-choice routing, pathway regularization, and pathway alignment. These modules guarantee random data allocation for pathway learning, promote diversity among shared models, and maintain consistency with target models. We evaluate SHAPOOL in the context of various membership inference attacks and show that it significantly reduces the computational cost of shadow model construction while maintaining comparable attack performance.",2025-10-15 11:50:40+00:00,2025-10-15 11:50:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13451v1
"Searching for a Farang: Collective Security among Women in Pattaya, Thailand","We report on two months of ethnographic fieldwork in a women's centre in Pattaya, and interviews with 76 participants. Our findings, as they relate to digital security, show how (i) women in Pattaya, often working in the sex and massage industries, perceived relationships with farang men as their best, and sometimes only, option to achieve security; (ii) the strategies used by the women to appeal to a farang involved presenting themselves online, mirroring how they were being advertised by bar owners to attract customers; (iii) appealing to what they considered `Western ideals', the women sought out `Western technologies' and appropriated them for their benefit; (iv) the women navigated a series of online security risks, such as scams and abuse, which shaped their search for a farang; (v) the women developed collective security through knowledge-sharing to protect themselves and each other in their search for a farang.

Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach,"Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication. Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.",2025-10-15 00:49:56+00:00,2025-10-15 00:49:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854v1
Local Differential Privacy for Federated Learning with Fixed Memory Usage and Per-Client Privacy,"Federated learning (FL) enables organizations to collaboratively train models without sharing their datasets. Despite this advantage, recent studies show that both client updates and the global model can leak private information, limiting adoption in sensitive domains such as healthcare. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers strong protection by letting each participant privatize updates before transmission. However, existing LDP methods were designed for centralized training and introduce challenges in FL, including high resource demands that can cause client dropouts and the lack of reliable privacy guarantees under asynchronous participation. These issues undermine model generalizability, fairness, and compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. To address them, we propose L-RDP, a DP method designed for LDP that ensures constant, lower memory usage to reduce dropouts and provides rigorous per-client privacy guarantees by accounting for intermittent participation.",2025-10-14 18:32:08+00:00,2025-10-14 18:32:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12908v1
Hash chaining degrades security at Facebook,"Modern web and digital application password storage relies on password hashing for storage and security. Ad-hoc upgrade of password storage to keep up with hash algorithm norms may be used to save costs but can introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities. This is the case in the password storage scheme used by Meta Platforms which services several billion monthly users worldwide. In this paper we present the first example of an exploit which demonstrates the security weakness of Facebook's password storage scheme, and discuss its implications. Proper ethical disclosure guidelines and vendor notification were followed.",2025-10-14 16:00:04+00:00,2025-10-14 16:00:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12665v1
Multi-Copy Security in Unclonable Cryptography,"Unclonable cryptography leverages the quantum no-cloning principle to copy-protect cryptographic functionalities. While most existing works address the basic single-copy security, the stronger notion of multi-copy security remains largely unexplored.   We introduce a generic compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant unclonable primitives to achieve multi-copy security, assuming only one-way functions. Using this framework, we obtain the first multi-copy secure constructions of public-key quantum money (termed quantum coins), single-decryptor encryption, unclonable encryption, and more. We also introduce an extended notion of quantum coins, called upgradable quantum coins, which allow weak (almost-public) verification under weaker assumptions and can be upgraded to full public verification under stronger assumptions by the bank simply publishing additional classical information.   Along the way, we give a generic compiler that upgrades single-copy secure single-decryptor encryption to a collusion-resistant one, assuming the existence of functional encryption, and construct the first multi-challenge secure unclonable encryption scheme, which we believe are of independent interest.",2025-10-14 15:23:42+00:00,2025-10-14 15:23:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12626v1

Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of these AI ""judges"" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.",2025-10-14 12:52:29+00:00,2025-10-14 12:52:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462v1
Attack-Specialized Deep Learning with Ensemble Fusion for Network Anomaly Detection,"The growing scale and sophistication of cyberattacks pose critical challenges to network security, particularly in detecting diverse intrusion types within imbalanced datasets. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to maintain high accuracy across both frequent and rare attacks, leading to increased false negatives for minority classes. To address this, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates specialized deep learning models with an ensemble meta-classifier. Each model is trained to detect a specific attack category, enabling tailored learning of class-specific patterns, while their collective outputs are fused by a Random Forest meta-classifier to improve overall decision reliability. The framework is evaluated on the NSL-KDD benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in handling class imbalance compared to conventional monolithic models. Results show significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score across all attack categories, including rare classes such as User to Root (U2R). The proposed system achieves near-perfect detection rates with minimal false alarms, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. This work advances the design of intrusion detection systems by combining specialization with ensemble learning, providing an effective and scalable solution for safeguarding modern networks.",2025-11-22 05:08:57+00:00,2025-10-14 12:41:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12455v2
Formal Models and Convergence Analysis for Context-Aware Security Verification,"Traditional security scanners fail when facing new attack patterns they haven't seen before. They rely on fixed rules and predetermined signatures, making them blind to novel threats. We present a fundamentally different approach: instead of memorizing specific attack patterns, we learn what makes systems genuinely secure. Our key insight is simple yet powerful: context determines vulnerability. A SQL query that's safe in one environment becomes dangerous in another. By modeling this context-vulnerability relationship, we achieve something remarkable: our system detects attacks it has never seen before. We introduce context-aware verification that learns from genuine system behavior. Through reconstruction learning on secure systems, we capture their essential characteristics. When an unknown attack deviates from these patterns, our system recognizes it, even without prior knowledge of that specific attack type. We prove this capability theoretically, showing detection rates improve exponentially with context information I(W;C). Our framework combines three components: (1) reconstruction learning that models secure behavior, (2) multi-scale graph reasoning that aggregates contextual clues, and (3) attention mechanisms guided by reconstruction differences. Extensive experiments validate our approach: detection accuracy jumps from 58 percent to 82 percent with full context, unknown attack detection improves by 31 percent, and our system maintains above 90 percent accuracy even against completely novel attack vectors.",2025-11-20 05:47:14+00:00,2025-10-14 12:21:36+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12440v2
HackWorld: Evaluating Computer-Use Agents on Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities,"Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.",2025-10-14 06:52:15+00:00,2025-10-14 06:52:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12200v1
Leaking Queries On Secure Stream Processing Systems,"Stream processing systems are important in modern applications in which data arrive continuously and need to be processed in real time. Because of their resource and scalability requirements, many of these systems run on the cloud, which is considered untrusted. Existing works on securing databases on the cloud focus on protecting the data, and most systems leverage trusted hardware for high performance. However, in stream processing systems, queries are as sensitive as the data because they contain the application logics.   We demonstrate that it is practical to extract the queries from stream processing systems that use Intel SGX for securing the execution engine. The attack performed by a malicious cloud provider is based on timing side channels, and it works in two phases. In the offline phase, the attacker profiles the execution time of individual stream operators, based on synthetic data. This phase outputs a model that identifies individual stream operators. In the online phase, the attacker isolates the operators that make up the query, monitors its execution, and recovers the operators using the model in the previous phase. We implement the attack based on popular data stream benchmarks using SecureStream and NEXMark, and demonstrate attack success rates of up to 92%. We further discuss approaches that can harden streaming processing systems against our attacks without incurring high overhead.",2025-10-15 02:48:29+00:00,2025-10-14 06:01:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12172v2
VeilAudit: Breaking the Deadlock Between Privacy and Accountability Across Blockchains,"Cross chain interoperability in blockchain systems exposes a fundamental tension between user privacy and regulatory accountability. Existing solutions enforce an all or nothing choice between full anonymity and mandatory identity disclosure, which limits adoption in regulated financial settings. We present VeilAudit, a cross chain auditing framework that introduces Auditor Only Linkability, which allows auditors to link transaction behaviors that originate from the same anonymous entity without learning its identity. VeilAudit achieves this with a user generated Linkable Audit Tag that embeds a zero knowledge proof to attest to its validity without exposing the user master wallet address, and with a special ciphertext that only designated auditors can test for linkage. To balance privacy and compliance, VeilAudit also supports threshold gated identity revelation under due process. VeilAudit further provides a mechanism for building reputation in pseudonymous environments, which enables applications such as cross chain credit scoring based on verifiable behavioral history. We formalize the security guarantees and develop a prototype that spans multiple EVM chains. Our evaluation shows that the framework is practical for today multichain environments.",2025-10-16 04:48:58+00:00,2025-10-14 05:16:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12153v2
Fairness-Constrained Optimization Attack in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single malicious client in the FL system.",2025-10-14 04:49:53+00:00,2025-10-14 04:49:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12143v1
Locket: Robust Feature-Locking Technique for Language Models,"Chatbot providers (e.g., OpenAI) rely on tiered subscription schemes to generate revenue, offering basic models for free users, and advanced models for paying subscribers. However, a finer-grained pay-to-unlock scheme for premium features (e.g., math, coding) is thought to be more economically viable for the providers. Such a scheme requires a feature-locking technique (FLoTE) which is (i) effective in refusing locked features, (ii) utility-preserving for unlocked features, (iii) robust against evasion or unauthorized credential sharing, and (iv) scalable to multiple features and users. However, existing FLoTEs (e.g., password-locked models) are not robust or scalable. We present Locket, the first robust and scalable FLoTE to enable pay-to-unlock schemes. Locket uses a novel merging approach to attach adapters to an LLM for refusing unauthorized features. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Locket is effective ($100$% refusal on locked features), utility-preserving ($\leq 7$% utility degradation in unlocked features), robust ($\leq 5$% attack success rate), and scales to multiple features and clients.",2025-10-14 03:35:59+00:00,2025-10-14 03:35:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12117v1
Over-Threshold Multiparty Private Set Intersection for Collaborative Network Intrusion Detection,"An important function of collaborative network intrusion detection is to analyze the network logs of the collaborators for joint IP addresses. However, sharing IP addresses in plain is sensitive and may be even subject to privacy legislation as it is personally identifiable information. In this paper, we present the privacy-preserving collection of IP addresses. We propose a single collector, over-threshold private set intersection protocol. In this protocol $N$ participants identify the IP addresses that appear in at least $t$ participant's sets without revealing any information about other IP addresses. Using a novel hashing scheme, we reduce the computational complexity of the previous state-of-the-art solution from $O(M(N \log{M}/t)^{2t})$ to $O(t^2M\binom{N}{t})$, where $M$ denotes the dataset size. This reduction makes it practically feasible to apply our protocol to real network logs. We test our protocol using joint networks logs of multiple institutions. Additionally, we present two deployment options: a collusion-safe deployment, which provides stronger security guarantees at the cost of increased communication overhead, and a non-interactive deployment, which assumes a non-colluding collector but offers significantly lower communication costs and applicable to many use cases of collaborative network intrusion detection similar to ours.",2025-10-14 00:58:58+00:00,2025-10-14 00:58:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12045v1
Security and Privacy Assessment of U.S. and Non-U.S. Android E-Commerce Applications,"E-commerce mobile applications are central to global financial transactions, making their security and privacy crucial.

Our analysis shows widespread SSL and certificate weaknesses, with approximately 92% using unsecured HTTP connections and an average MobSF security score of 40.92/100. Over-privileged permissions were identified in 77 apps. While U.S. apps exhibited fewer manifest, code, and certificate vulnerabilities, both groups showed similar network-related issues.

Meta-Guardian: An Early Evaluation of an On-device Application to Mitigate Psychography Data Leakage in Immersive Technologies,"The use of Immersive Technologies has shown its potential to revolutionize many sectors such as health, entertainment, education, and industrial sectors. Immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) have redefined user interaction through real-time biometric and behavioral tracking. Although Immersive Technologies (XR) essentially need the collection of the biometric data which acts as a baseline to create immersive experience, however, this ongoing feedback information (includes biometrics) poses critical privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data collected. A comprehensive review of recent literature explored the technical dimensions of related problem; however, they largely overlook the challenge particularly the intricacies of real-time biometric data filtering within head-mounted display system. Motivated from this, in this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving system architecture that identifies and filters biometric signals (within the VR headset) in real-time before transmission or storage. Implemented as a modular Unity Software-development Kit (SDK) compatible with major immersive platforms, our solution (named Meta-Guardian) employs machine learning models for signal classification and a filtering mechanism to block sensitive data. This framework aims to enable developers to embed privacy-by-design principles into immersive experiences on various headsets and applications.",2025-10-13 23:27:33+00:00,2025-10-13 23:27:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15989v1
CTIArena: Benchmarking LLM Knowledge and Reasoning Across Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence,"Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks, lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories, structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques to fully unlock their potential for CTI.",2025-10-13 22:10:17+00:00,2025-10-13 22:10:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11974v1
"Robust ML-based Detection of Conventional, LLM-Generated, and Adversarial Phishing Emails Using Advanced Text Preprocessing","Phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating highly convincing malicious content. Unlike earlier phishing attempts which are identifiable by grammatical errors, misspellings, incorrect phrasing, and inconsistent formatting, LLM generated emails are grammatically sound, contextually relevant, and linguistically natural. These advancements make phishing emails increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones, challenging traditional detection mechanisms. Conventional phishing detection systems often fail when faced with emails crafted by LLMs or manipulated using adversarial perturbation techniques. To address this challenge, we propose a robust phishing email detection system featuring an enhanced text preprocessing pipeline. This pipeline includes spelling correction and word splitting to counteract adversarial modifications and improve detection accuracy. Our approach integrates widely adopted natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate our models on publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails, achieving a detection accuracy of 94.26% and F1-score of 84.39% in model deployment setting. To assess robustness, we further evaluate our models using adversarial phishing samples generated by four attack methods in Python TextAttack framework. Additionally, we evaluate models' performance against phishing emails generated by LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama. Results highlight the resilience of models against evolving AI-powered phishing threats.",2025-10-13 20:34:19+00:00,2025-10-13 20:34:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11915v1
Lightweight CNN-Based Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection Using 2D Traffic Representations,"Wi-Fi networks are ubiquitous in both home and enterprise environments, serving as a primary medium for Internet access and forming the backbone of modern IoT ecosystems. However, their inherent vulnerabilities, combined with widespread adoption, create opportunities for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data stored on connected devices. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for Wi-Fi environments. Building on our previous work, we convert network traffic into two-dimensional data representations and use them to train DL models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We implement five distinct techniques for generating the two-dimensional representations, and to ensure low detection latency, we adopt lightweight CNN architectures in our NIDS. The models are trained using the AWID3 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for Wi-Fi NIDS research, and are evaluated for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive detection performance with low inference time, making it suitable for real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios.",2025-10-13 19:59:24+00:00,2025-10-13 19:59:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11898v1
High-Probability Bounds For Heterogeneous Local Differential Privacy,"We study statistical estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) when users may hold heterogeneous privacy levels and accuracy must be guaranteed with high probability. Departing from the common in-expectation analyses, and for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation problems, we develop finite sample upper bounds in $\ell_2$-norm that hold with probability at least $1-β$. We complement these results with matching minimax lower bounds, establishing the optimality (up to constants) of our guarantees in the heterogeneous LDP regime. We further study distribution learning in $\ell_\infty$-distance, designing an algorithm with high-probability guarantees under heterogeneous privacy demands. Our techniques offer principled guidance for designing mechanisms in settings with user-specific privacy levels.",2025-10-13 19:54:44+00:00,2025-10-13 19:54:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11895v1
Deep Research Brings Deeper Harm,"Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice: simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet, jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks, as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap, we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content, compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to DR agents.

Countermind: A Multi-Layered Security Architecture for Large Language Models,"The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally challenged by ""form-first"" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking, where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a multi-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive, post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement model. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface, provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction (PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors.

BlackIce: A Containerized Red Teaming Toolkit for AI Security Testing,"AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising significant concerns about their safety and security. Consequently, AI red teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.   Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML) models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security testing, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup, initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container, either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular architecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools, and the types of evaluations they support.",2025-10-13 18:20:16+00:00,2025-10-13 18:20:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11823v1
A Comprehensive Survey of Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses in Tor: Advances and Open Challenges,"The Tor network provides users with strong anonymity by routing their internet traffic through multiple relays. While Tor encrypts traffic and hides IP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the website fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting accuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have proposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic regularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to obfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail trade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack methodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap by systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains: datasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth comparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations under diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab browsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and identifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for advancing stronger privacy protection in Tor.",2025-11-22 04:27:58+00:00,2025-10-13 18:03:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11804v3
Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-based Safety Guardrails,"Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

"Uncertainty-Aware, Risk-Adaptive Access Control for Agentic Systems using an LLM-Judged TBAC Model","The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent, novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge. This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.",2025-10-13 13:52:33+00:00,2025-10-13 13:52:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11414v1
TBRD: TESLA Authenticated UAS Broadcast Remote ID,"Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight, mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system provides a 50\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and operational use cases.",2025-10-13 12:41:04+00:00,2025-10-13 12:41:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11343v1
Collaborative Shadows: Distributed Backdoor Attacks in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems,"LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into next-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/whfeLingYu/Distributed-Backdoor-Attacks-in-MAS.",2025-10-13 10:34:05+00:00,2025-10-13 10:34:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11246v1
Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models,"To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development, ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug, evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus narrowing down the vulnerability detection ""window"" and providing more fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and spurious correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/pralab/vuln-localization-eval.",2025-10-13 09:34:40+00:00,2025-10-13 09:34:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202v1
TypePilot: Leveraging the Scala Type System for Secure LLM-generated Code,"Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.",2025-10-13 08:44:01+00:00,2025-10-13 08:44:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11151v1
A Symmetric-Key Cryptosystem Based on the Burnside Ring of a Compact Lie Group,"Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed, finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$; and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$ and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators $\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is \emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext distinguisher based on dihedral probes.",2025-10-13 01:57:22+00:00,2025-10-13 01:57:22+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10901v1
A Simple and Efficient One-Shot Signature Scheme,"One-shot signatures (OSS) are a powerful and uniquely quantum cryptographic primitive which allows anyone, given common reference string, to come up with a public verification key $\mathsf{pk}$ and a secret signing state $|\mathsf{sk}\rangle$. With the secret signing state, one can produce the signature of any one message, but no more. In a recent breakthrough work, Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025) constructed one-shot signatures, either unconditionally in a classical oracle model or assuming post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscation and the hardness of Learning with Errors (LWE) in the plain model.   In this work, we address the inefficiency of the Shmueli-Zhandry construction which signs messages bit-by-bit, resulting in signing keys of $Θ(λ^4)$ qubits and signatures of size $Θ(λ^3)$ bits for polynomially long messages, where $λ$ is the security parameter. We construct a new, simple, direct, and efficient one-shot signature scheme which can sign messages of any polynomial length using signing keys of $Θ(λ^2)$ qubits and signatures of size $Θ(λ^2)$ bits. We achieve corresponding savings in runtimes, in both the oracle model and the plain model. In addition, unlike the Shmueli-Zhandry construction, our scheme achieves perfect correctness.   Our scheme also achieves strong signature incompressibility, which implies a public-key quantum fire scheme with perfect correctness among other applications, correcting an error in a recent work of Çakan, Goyal and Shmueli (QCrypt 2025) and recovering their applications.",2025-10-13 01:53:00+00:00,2025-10-13 01:53:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10899v1
Safeguarding Efficacy in Large Language Models: Evaluating Resistance to Human-Written and Algorithmic Adversarial Prompts,"This paper presents a systematic security assessment of four prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) against diverse adversarial attack vectors. We evaluate Phi-2, Llama-2-7B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 across four distinct attack categories: human-written prompts, AutoDAN, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), and Tree-of-Attacks-with-pruning (TAP). Our comprehensive evaluation employs 1,200 carefully stratified prompts from the SALAD-Bench dataset, spanning six harm categories. Results demonstrate significant variations in model robustness, with Llama-2 achieving the highest overall security (3.4% average attack success rate) while Phi-2 exhibits the greatest vulnerability (7.0% average attack success rate). We identify critical transferability patterns where GCG and TAP attacks, though ineffective against their target model (Llama-2), achieve substantially higher success rates when transferred to other models (up to 17% for GPT-4). Statistical analysis using Friedman tests reveals significant differences in vulnerability across harm categories ($p < 0.001$), with malicious use prompts showing the highest attack success rates (10.71% average). Our findings contribute to understanding cross-model security vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights for developing targeted defense mechanisms",2025-10-12 21:48:34+00:00,2025-10-12 21:48:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15973v1
GPS Spoofing Attack Detection in Autonomous Vehicles Using Adaptive DBSCAN,"As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold (ε) in real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning. To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%, 99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS spoofing threats.",2025-10-12 19:06:44+00:00,2025-10-12 19:06:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10766v1
Toxic Ink on Immutable Paper: Content Moderation for Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs),"Decentralized communication is becoming an important use case within Web3. On Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs). However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no protocol-level support for content moderation.   We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD, where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.   Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially responsible.",2025-10-12 19:02:57+00:00,2025-10-12 19:02:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10761v1

Predicting Module-Lattice Reduction,"Is module-lattice reduction better than unstructured lattice reduction? This question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission (Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehlé, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable worst-case asymptotic behavior.   In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $Δ_K$ of the number field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back into a gain or loss on the blocksize $β$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$ of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $β+ \log(|Δ_K| / d^d)β/(d\log β) + o(β/ \log β)$ to reach the same slope as unstructured BKZ with blocksize $β$. This asymptotic summary hides further terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics. Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for some cyclotomic fields.   For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|Δ_K| = d^d$, and conclude that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have $|Δ_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $Θ(β/\log β)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of $\exp(Θ(β/\log β))$.",2025-10-12 10:46:55+00:00,2025-10-12 10:46:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10540v1
RiskTagger: An LLM-based Agent for Automatic Annotation of Web3 Crypto Money Laundering Behaviors,"While the rapid growth of Web3 has driven the development of decentralized finance, user anonymity and cross-chain asset flows make on-chain laundering behaviors more covert and complex. In this context, constructing high-quality anti-money laundering(AML) datasets has become essential for risk-control systems and on-chain forensic analysis, yet current practices still rely heavily on manual efforts with limited efficiency and coverage. In this paper, we introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic annotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to replace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges: extracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain transaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger implements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor, a multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer, forming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack (with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100% accuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90% coverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering behavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML research.",2025-10-12 08:54:28+00:00,2025-10-12 08:54:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17848v1
One Token Embedding Is Enough to Deadlock Your Large Reasoning Model,"Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional tokens (e.g., ""Wait"", ""But"") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the continuous-to-discrete projection gap: naïve projections of adversarial embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning (in)efficiency.",2025-10-12 07:42:57+00:00,2025-10-12 07:42:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15965v1
PrediQL: Automated Testing of GraphQL APIs with LLMs,"GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.",2025-10-19 14:01:08+00:00,2025-10-12 01:49:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10407v2
MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation,"Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging, as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated. This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively. Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%, respectively.",2025-10-11 16:14:56+00:00,2025-10-11 16:14:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271v1
System Password Security: Attack and Defense Mechanisms,"System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA 256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings, it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.",2025-10-11 15:01:58+00:00,2025-10-11 15:01:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10246v1
ADMIT: Few-shot Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based Fact Checking,"Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.",2025-10-11 14:50:40+00:00,2025-10-11 14:50:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13842v1
Output Supervision Can Obfuscate the Chain of Thought,"OpenAI (2025) showed that training against a chain of thought (CoT) monitor can cause obfuscated CoTs, which contain bad behavior the monitor cannot detect. They proposed to keep CoTs monitorable by training only against output monitors that do not have access to CoT. We show that such training can still cause obfuscated CoTs via two mechanisms. First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced. We introduce two mitigations to address these two issues, which achieve a Pareto improvement in terms of monitorability and task performance compared to regular training.",2025-10-11 08:13:02+00:00,2025-10-11 08:13:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11584v1
SecureWebArena: A Holistic Security Evaluation Benchmark for LVLM-based Web Agents,"Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes 2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose, agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1) a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment.",2025-10-11 07:18:12+00:00,2025-10-11 07:18:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10073v1
Prismo: A Decision Support System for Privacy-Preserving ML Framework Selection,"Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability. Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for privacy and security application developers.   We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption. Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.",2025-10-11 03:27:15+00:00,2025-10-11 03:27:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09985v1
Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection,"Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.",2025-10-11 03:24:51+00:00,2025-10-11 03:24:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1
HTTP Request Synchronization Defeats Discrepancy Attacks,"Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways. Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.   In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops, eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating its practical impact.",2025-10-11 01:42:38+00:00,2025-10-11 01:42:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09952v1
Bluetooth Fingerprint Identification Under Domain Shift Through Transient Phase Derivative,"Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time, we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.",2025-10-11 00:39:38+00:00,2025-10-11 00:39:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09940v1
The Data Enclave Advantage: A New Paradigm for Least-Privileged Data Access in a Zero-Trust World,"As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows, accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches. While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level, especially for companies handling valuable data at scale.   In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level. We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital path for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data environment.",2025-10-10 15:54:58+00:00,2025-10-10 15:54:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09494v1
Locally Optimal Private Sampling: Beyond the Global Minimax,"We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in $f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class $\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this, we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$. Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of $f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.",2025-10-10 15:50:48+00:00,2025-10-10 15:50:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09485v1
Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols,"AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.",2025-10-10 15:12:44+00:00,2025-10-10 15:12:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09462v1
Target speaker anonymization in multi-speaker recordings,"Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario. This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation methodologies.",2025-10-10 11:59:45+00:00,2025-10-10 11:59:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09307v1
Assessing the Impact of Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms on Blockchains,"The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional encryption algorithms, motivating the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5, compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to ensure reproducibility and encourage further research.",2025-10-10 11:12:53+00:00,2025-10-10 11:12:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09271v1
GREAT: Generalizable Backdoor Attacks in RLHF via Emotion-Aware Trigger Synthesis,"Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.",2025-10-10 10:59:14+00:00,2025-10-10 10:59:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09260v1
Zk-SNARK Marketplace with Proof of Useful Work,"Proof of Work (PoW) is widely regarded as the most secure permissionless blockchain consensus protocol. However, its reliance on computationally intensive yet externally useless puzzles results in excessive electric energy wasting. To alleviate this, Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) has been explored as an alternative to secure blockchain platforms while also producing real-world value. Despite this promise, existing PoUW proposals often fail to embed the integrity of the chain and identity of the miner into the puzzle solutions, not meeting necessary requirements for PoW and thus rendering them vulnerable. In this work, we propose a PoUW consensus protocol that computes client-outsourced zk-SNARKs proofs as a byproduct, which are at the same time used to secure the consensus protocol. We further leverage this mechanism to design a decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such marketplace operating at the consensus layer, while meeting all necessary properties of PoW.",2025-10-10 10:38:42+00:00,2025-10-10 10:38:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09729v1
Provable Watermarking for Data Poisoning Attacks,"In recent years, data poisoning attacks have been increasingly designed to appear harmless and even beneficial, often with the intention of verifying dataset ownership or safeguarding private data from unauthorized use. However, these developments have the potential to cause misunderstandings and conflicts, as data poisoning has traditionally been regarded as a security threat to machine learning systems. To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless poisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling users to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we propose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge. We introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data poisoning: {\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\em poisoning-concurrent watermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is $Θ(\sqrt{d}/ε_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within the range of $Θ(1/ε_w^2)$ to $O(\sqrt{d}/ε_p)$ for poisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably ensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the practicality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on several attacks, models, and datasets.",2025-10-10 09:45:33+00:00,2025-10-10 09:45:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09210v1
Exploiting Web Search Tools of AI Agents for Data Exfiltration,"Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate long-standing threats.",2025-10-10 07:39:01+00:00,2025-10-10 07:39:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09093v1
The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections,"How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation process is flawed.   Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make reliable and convincing claims of robustness.",2025-10-10 05:51:04+00:00,2025-10-10 05:51:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09023v1
A Demonstration of Self-Adaptive Jamming Attack Detection in AI/ML Integrated O-RAN,"The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.",2025-10-10 00:18:00+00:00,2025-10-10 00:18:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09706v1
Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses.

The Model's Language Matters: A Comparative Privacy Analysis of LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction, counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.",2025-10-09 20:59:42+00:00,2025-10-09 20:59:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08813v1
TAPAS: Datasets for Learning the Learning with Errors Problem,"AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform ""classical"" attacks on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach, a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE.

Are Voters Willing to Collectively Secure Elections? Unraveling a Practical Blockchain Voting System,"Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic voting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized, large-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of collectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret holders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively secure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance between strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The proposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure ballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain transparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain knowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity. To evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high willingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release, and high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate that voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical deployment is feasible.",2025-10-09 18:02:40+00:00,2025-10-09 18:02:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08700v1
Compiling Any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ into a (Succinct) Classical Interactive Argument,"We present a generic compiler that converts any $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ protocol into a succinct interactive argument where the communication and the verifier are classical, and where post-quantum soundness relies on the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of the Learning with Errors ($\mathsf{LWE}$) problem. Prior to this work, such a compiler for $\mathsf{MIP}^{*}$ was given by Kalai, Lombardi, Vaikuntanathan and Yang (STOC 2022), but the post-quantum soundness of this compiler is still under investigation.   More generally, our compiler can be applied to any $\mathsf{QIP}$ protocol which is sound only against semi-malicious provers that follow the prescribed protocol, but with possibly malicious initial state. Our compiler consists of two steps. We first show that if a language $\mathcal{L}$ has a $\mathsf{QIP}$ with semi-malicious soundness, where the prover runs in time $T$, then $\mathcal{L} \in \mathsf{QMATIME}(T)$. Then we construct a succinct classical argument for any such language, where the communication complexity grows polylogarithmically with $T$, under the post-quantum sub-exponential hardness of $\mathsf{LWE}$.   Note: After this work was finished, an independent and concurrent work (Baroni et al. 2025) resolved the question of quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler.",2025-10-20 12:00:25+00:00,2025-10-09 17:35:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08495v2
An Improved Quantum Algorithm for 3-Tuple Lattice Sieving,"The assumed hardness of the Shortest Vector Problem in high-dimensional lattices is one of the cornerstones of post-quantum cryptography. The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to $2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby ''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and $2^{o(d)}$ qubits.

Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed ""spooky pebble games"" because the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) using space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of concrete line graph lengths $\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$.   We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic. For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Ekerå and Gärtner for Shor's algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer factorization.",2025-10-09 16:45:58+00:00,2025-10-09 16:45:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08432v1
A Haskell to FHE Transpiler,"Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the evaluation of programs directly on encrypted data. However, because only basic operations can be performed on ciphertexts, programs must be expressed as boolean or arithmetic circuits. This low-level representation makes implementing applications for FHE significantly more cumbersome than writing code in a high-level language. To reduce this burden, several transpilers have been developed that translate high-level code into circuit representations. In this work, we extend the range of high-level languages that can target FHE by introducing a transpiler for Haskell, which converts Haskell programs into Boolean circuits suitable for homomorphic evaluation. Our second contribution is the automatic parallelization of these generated circuits. We implement an evaluator that executes gates in parallel by parallelizing each layer of the circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) and the AES encryption standard. Prior work has parallelized AES encryption manually. We demonstrate that the automated method outperforms some but not all manual parallelizations of AES evaluations under FHE. We achieve an evaluation time of 28 seconds for a parallel execution with 16 threads and an evaluation time of 8 seconds for a parallel execution with 100 threads",2025-10-09 15:28:27+00:00,2025-10-09 15:28:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08343v1
Systematic Assessment of Cache Timing Vulnerabilities on RISC-V Processors,"While interest in the open RISC-V instruction set architecture is growing, tools to assess the security of concrete processor implementations are lacking. There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54 and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In addition, our evaluation reveals that $65.9\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to support the development of countermeasures.",2025-10-10 13:15:40+00:00,2025-10-09 14:29:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08272v2
A Semantic Model for Audit of Cloud Engines based on ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022,"Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure, yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.",2025-10-09 11:32:35+00:00,2025-10-09 11:32:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09690v1
A Unified Approach to Quantum Key Leasing with a Classical Lessor,"Secure key leasing allows a cryptographic key to be leased as a quantum state in such a way that the key can later be revoked in a verifiable manner. In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al. (Eurocrypt 2025), and our PRF and digital signature schemes are respectively the first PRF and digital signature with classical-lessor secure key leasing property.",2025-10-09 11:09:34+00:00,2025-10-09 11:09:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08079v1
Backdoor Vectors: a Task Arithmetic View on Backdoor Attacks and Defenses,"Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks. Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\ (BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\ (SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose $Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.",2025-10-09 09:54:05+00:00,2025-10-09 09:54:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08016v1
CREST-Search: Comprehensive Red-teaming for Evaluating Safety Threats in Large Language Models Powered by Web Search,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization, and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs, allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure trustworthy deployment.",2025-10-09 09:44:14+00:00,2025-10-09 09:44:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09689v1
"Fewer Weights, More Problems: A Practical Attack on LLM Pruning","Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.",2025-10-10 08:42:47+00:00,2025-10-09 09:17:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07985v2
Decentralised Blockchain Management Through Digital Twins,"The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain with minimal overhead.",2025-10-09 07:54:26+00:00,2025-10-09 07:54:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07901v1
MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation,"This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

Practical and Stealthy Touch-Guided Jailbreak Attacks on Deployed Mobile Vision-Language Agents,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities in their perception and interaction remain critically understudied. Existing research often relies on conspicuous overlays, elevated permissions, or unrealistic threat assumptions, limiting stealth and real-world feasibility. In this paper, we introduce a practical and stealthy jailbreak attack framework, which comprises three key components: (i) non-privileged perception compromise, which injects visual payloads into the application interface without requiring elevated system permissions; (ii) agent-attributable activation, which leverages input attribution signals to distinguish agent from human interactions and limits prompt exposure to transient intervals to preserve stealth from end users; and (iii) efficient one-shot jailbreak, a heuristic iterative deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs keyword-level detoxification to bypass built-in safety alignment of LVLMs. Moreover, we developed three representative Android applications and curated a prompt-injection dataset for mobile agents. We evaluated our attack across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models, and observed high planning and execution hijack rates (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution), exposing a fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents and underscoring critical implications for autonomous smartphone operation.",2025-11-20 03:13:23+00:00,2025-10-09 05:34:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07809v2
Fortifying LLM-Based Code Generation with Graph-Based Reasoning on Secure Coding Practices,"The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships, and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable, model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88% improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.",2025-10-08 22:24:52+00:00,2025-10-08 22:24:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09682v1
A Minrank-based Encryption Scheme à la Alekhnovich-Regev,"Introduced in 2003 and 2005, Alekhnovich and Regev' schemes were the first public-key encryptions whose security is only based on the average hardness of decoding random linear codes and LWE, without other security assumptions. Such security guarantees made them very popular, being at the origin of the now standardized HQC or Kyber.   We present an adaptation of Alekhnovich and Regev' encryption scheme whose security is only based on the hardness of a slight variation of MinRank, the so-called stationary-MinRank problem. We succeeded to reach this strong security guarantee by showing that stationary-MinRank benefits from a search-to-decision reduction. Our scheme therefore brings a partial answer to the long-standing open question of building an encryption scheme whose security relies solely on the hardness of MinRank.   Finally, we show after a thoroughly security analysis that our scheme is practical and competitive with other encryption schemes admitting such strong security guarantees. Our scheme is slightly less efficient than FrodoKEM, but much more efficient than Alekhnovich and Regev' original schemes, with possibilities of improvements by considering more structure, in the same way as HQC and Kyber.",2025-10-08 22:11:04+00:00,2025-10-08 22:11:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07584v1
MIRANDA: short signatures from a leakage-free full-domain-hash scheme,"We present $\mathsf{Miranda}$, the first family of full-domain-hash signatures based on matrix codes. This signature scheme fulfils the paradigm of Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan ($\mathsf{GPV}$), which gives strong security guarantees. Our trapdoor is very simple and generic: if we propose it with matrix codes, it can actually be instantiated in many other ways since it only involves a subcode of a decodable code (or lattice) in a unique decoding regime of parameters. Though $\mathsf{Miranda}$ signing algorithm relies on a decoding task where there is exactly one solution, there are many possible signatures given a message to sign and we ensure that signatures are not leaking information on their underlying trapdoor by means of a very simple procedure involving the drawing of a small number of uniform bits. In particular $\mathsf{Miranda}$ does not use a rejection sampling procedure which makes its implementation a very simple task contrary to other $\mathsf{GPV}$-like signatures schemes such as $\mathsf{Falcon}$ or even $\mathsf{Wave}$.   We instantiate $\mathsf{Miranda}$ with the famous family of Gabidulin codes represented as spaces of matrices and we study thoroughly its security (in the EUF-CMA security model). For~$128$ bits of classical security, the signature sizes are as low as~$90$ bytes and the public key sizes are in the order of~$2.6$ megabytes.",2025-10-08 19:24:24+00:00,2025-10-08 19:24:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07479v1
PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing,"Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII) from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference. Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.",2025-10-08 18:58:41+00:00,2025-10-08 18:58:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452v1
Advancing Security in Software-Defined Vehicles: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy,"Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) introduce innovative features that extend the vehicle's lifecycle through the integration of outsourced applications and continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. This shift necessitates robust cybersecurity and system resilience. While research on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) has been extensive, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research. SDVs, with their extensive connectivity, have a broader attack surface. Besides, their software-centric nature introduces additional vulnerabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem, enabling technologies, and the principal cyberattack entry points that arise from their architectural and operational characteristics. We also introduce a novel, layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV properties and attack paths, and use it to analyze representative studies and experimental approaches.",2025-10-08 17:03:58+00:00,2025-10-08 17:03:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09675v1

Pingmark: A Textual Protocol for Universal Spatial Mentions,"Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context through a minimal symbol: !@.

A multi-layered embedded intrusion detection framework for programmable logic controllers,"Industrial control system (ICS) operations use trusted endpoints like human machine interfaces (HMIs) and workstations to relay commands to programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Because most PLCs lack layered defenses, compromise of a trusted endpoint can drive unsafe actuator commands and risk safety-critical operation. This research presents an embedded intrusion detection system that runs inside the controller and uses header-level telemetry to detect and respond to network attacks. The system combines a semi-supervised anomaly detector and a supervised attack classifier. We evaluate the approach on a midstream oil-terminal testbed using three datasets collected during tanker-truck loading. The anomaly detector achieves zero missed attacks, corresponding to 0.998 Matthews correlation. The supervised stage attains 97.37 percent hold-out accuracy and 97.03 percent external accuracy.

"Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy, Accuracy, and Efficiency","We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph. Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves (epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity; and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility trade-offs.",2025-10-08 15:30:27+00:00,2025-10-08 15:30:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07136v1
The Knowledge Complexity of Quantum Problems,"Foundational results in theoretical computer science have established that everything provable, is provable in zero knowledge. However, this assertion fundamentally assumes a classical interpretation of computation and many interesting physical statements that one can hope to prove are not characterized. In this work, we consider decision problems, where the problem instance itself is specified by a (pure) quantum state. We discuss several motivating examples for this notion and, as our main technical result, we show that every quantum problem that is provable with an interactive protocol, is also provable in zero-knowledge. Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography. In addition, we show how our techniques yield a protocol for the Uhlmann transformation problem that achieves a meaningful notion of zero-knowledge, also in the presence of a malicious verifier.",2025-10-08 12:00:32+00:00,2025-10-08 12:00:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06923v1

We train the DeepJSCC module to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD hashes of source and reconstructed images.

Distilling Lightweight Language Models for C/C++ Vulnerabilities,"The increasing complexity of modern software systems exacerbates the prevalence of security vulnerabilities, posing risks of severe breaches and substantial economic loss. Consequently, robust code vulnerability detection is essential for software security.

By integrating data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a unified, single-task workflow, FineSec offers a streamlined approach. Extensive evaluations on C/C++ codebases demonstrate its superiority over both base models and larger LLMs in identifying complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, establishing FineSec as a practical and scalable solution for real-world software security.

However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.",2025-10-08 00:13:02+00:00,2025-10-08 00:13:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06530v1
BATTLE for Bitcoin: Capital-Efficient Optimistic Bridges with Large Committees,"We present BATTLE for Bitcoin, a DoS-resilient dispute layer that secures optimistic bridges between Bitcoin and rollups or sidechains. Our design adapts the BATTLE tournament protocol to Bitcoin's UTXO model using BitVM-style FLEX components and garbled circuits with on-demand L1 security bonds. Disputes are resolved in logarithmic rounds while recycling rewards, keeping the honest asserter's minimum initial capital constant even under many permissionless challengers. The construction is fully contestable (challengers can supply higher-work counter-proofs) and relies only on standard timelocks and pre-signed transaction DAGs, without new opcodes.   For $N$ operators, the protocol requires $O(N^2)$ pre-signed transactions, signatures, and message exchanges, yet remains practical at $N\!\gtrsim\!10^3$, enabling high decentralization.",2025-10-07 21:11:48+00:00,2025-10-07 21:11:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06468v1
"A Survey on Agentic Security: Applications, Threats and Defenses","The rapid shift from passive LLMs to autonomous LLM-agents marks a new paradigm in cybersecurity. While these agents can act as powerful tools for both offensive and defensive operations, the very agentic context introduces a new class of inherent security risks. In this work we present the first holistic survey of the agentic security landscape, structuring the field around three interdependent pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them. A detailed cross-cutting analysis shows emerging trends in agent architecture while revealing critical research gaps in model and modality coverage.",2025-10-07 20:32:20+00:00,2025-10-07 20:32:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06445v1
Proofs of No Intrusion,"A central challenge in data security is not just preventing theft, but detecting whether it has occurred. Classically, this is impossible because a perfect copy leaves no evidence. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, forbids general duplication, opening up new possibilities.   We introduce Proofs of No Intrusion, which enable a classical client to remotely test whether a quantum server has been hacked and the client's data stolen. Crucially, the test does not destroy the data being tested, avoiding the need to store a backup elsewhere. We define and construct proofs of no intrusion for ciphertexts assuming fully homomorphic encryption. Additionally, we show how to equip several constructions of unclonable primitives with proofs of non-intrusion, such as unclonable decryption keys and signature tokens. Conceptually, proofs of non-intrusion can be defined for essentially any unclonable primitive.   At the heart of our techniques is a new method for non-destructively testing coset states with classical communication. It can be viewed as a non-destructive proof of knowledge of a measurement result of the coset state.",2025-10-07 20:11:20+00:00,2025-10-07 20:11:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06432v1
Breaking Precision Time: OS Vulnerability Exploits Against IEEE 1588,"The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), standardized as IEEE 1588, provides sub-microsecond synchronization across distributed systems and underpins critical infrastructure in telecommunications, finance, power systems, and industrial automation. While prior work has extensively analyzed PTP's vulnerability to network-based attacks, prompting the development of cryptographic protections and anomaly detectors, these defenses presume an uncompromised host. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical blind spot in current threat models: kernel-level adversaries operating from within the host running the PTP stack. We present the first systematic study of kernel-rooted attacks on PTP, demonstrating how privileged attackers can manipulate system time by corrupting key interfaces without altering PTP network traffic. We implement three attack primitives, constant offset, progressive skew, and random jitter, using in-kernel payloads, and evaluate their impact on the widely used ptp4l and phc2sys daemons. Our experiments reveal that these attacks can silently destabilize clock synchronization, bypassing existing PTP security extensions. These findings highlight the urgent need to reconsider host-level trust assumptions and integrate kernel integrity into the design of secure time synchronization systems.",2025-10-07 20:00:42+00:00,2025-10-07 20:00:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06421v1
Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification,"The no-cloning theorem can be used as a basis for quantum money constructions which guarantee unconditionally unforgeable currency. Existing schemes, however, either (i) require long-term quantum memory and quantum communication between the user and the bank in order to verify the validity of a bill or (ii) fail to protect user privacy due to the uniqueness of each bill issued by the bank, which can allow its usage to be tracked. We introduce a construction of single-use quantum money that gives users the ability to detect whether the issuing authority is tracking them, employing an auditing procedure for which we prove unconditional security. Bill validation is classical, and hence does not require long-term quantum memory or quantum communication, making the protocol relatively practical to deploy. We discuss potential applications beyond money, including anonymous one-time pads and voting.",2025-10-21 08:15:05+00:00,2025-10-07 17:59:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06212v2
Adversarial-Resilient RF Fingerprinting: A CNN-GAN Framework for Rogue Transmitter Detection,"Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.",2025-10-07 17:04:50+00:00,2025-10-07 17:04:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09663v1

A hybrid recursive/queue execution engine exploits multi-core parallelism while maintaining deterministic output. Utility-preserving enhancements include NaN-pattern pre-partitioning, metric-driven cut scoring, and dynamic suppression budget management. Experiments on the 48k-record UCI ADULT dataset and synthetically scaled versions up to 1M records achieve lower Discernibility Metric scores than Original Mondrian for numeric quasi-identifier sets while parallel processing delivers up to 4x speedup vs. sequential Core Mondrian.

On the Quantum Equivalence between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$,"Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [CLZ22] introduced the problems $S|LWE\rangle$ and $C|LWE\rangle$ as quantum analogues of the Learning with Errors problem, designed to construct quantum algorithms for the Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution ($ISIS$) problem. Several later works have used this framework for constructing new quantum algorithms in specific cases. However, the general relation between all these problems is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the equivalence between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$. We present the first fully generic reduction from $ISIS$ to $S|LWE\rangle$, valid even in the presence of errors in the underlying algorithms. We then explore the reverse direction, introducing an inhomogeneous variant of $C|LWE\rangle$, denoted $IC|LWE\rangle$, and show that $IC|LWE\rangle$ reduces to $S|LWE\rangle$. Finally, we prove that, under certain recoverability conditions, an algorithm for $ISIS$ can be transformed into one for $S|LWE\rangle$. We instantiate this reverse reduction by tweaking a known algorithm for $(I)SIS_\infty$ in order to construct quantum algorithm for $S|LWE\rangle$ when the alphabet size q is a small power of 2, recovering some results of Bai et al. [BJK+ 25]. Our results thus clarify the landscape of reductions between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$, and we show both their strong connection as well as the remaining barriers for showing full equivalence.",2025-10-07 16:25:47+00:00,2025-10-07 16:25:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06097v1
Refusal Falls off a Cliff: How Safety Alignment Fails in Reasoning?,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as \textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.",2025-10-07 15:32:59+00:00,2025-10-07 15:32:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06036v1

We present an end-to-end audit of 272 Android mHealth apps from Google Play, combining permission forensics, static vulnerability analysis, and user review mining. Our multi-tool assessment with MobSF, RiskInDroid, and OWASP Mobile Audit revealed systemic weaknesses: 26.1% request fine-grained location without disclosure, 18.3% initiate calls silently, and 73 send SMS without notice. Nearly half (49.3%) still use deprecated SHA-1 encryption, 42 transmit unencrypted data, and 6 remain vulnerable to StrandHogg 2.0.

Fairness in Token Delegation: Mitigating Voting Power Concentration in DAOs,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) aim to enable participatory governance, but in practice face challenges of voter apathy, concentration of voting power, and misaligned delegation. Existing delegation mechanisms often reinforce visibility biases, where a small set of highly ranked delegates accumulate disproportionate influence regardless of their alignment with the broader community. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of delegation in DAO governance, combining on-chain data from five major protocols with off-chain discussions from 14 DAO forums. We develop a methodology to link forum participants to on-chain addresses, extract governance interests using large language models, and compare these interests against delegates' historical behavior. Our analysis reveals that delegations are frequently misaligned with token holders' expressed priorities and that current ranking-based interfaces exacerbate power concentration. We argue that incorporating interest alignment into delegation processes could mitigate these imbalances and improve the representativeness of DAO decision-making.",2025-10-07 11:53:40+00:00,2025-10-07 11:53:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05830v1
Enhancing Automotive Security with a Hybrid Approach towards Universal Intrusion Detection System,"Security measures are essential in the automotive industry to detect intrusions in-vehicle networks. However, developing a one-size-fits-all Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is challenging because each vehicle has unique data profiles. This is due to the complex and dynamic nature of the data generated by vehicles regarding their model, driving style, test environment, and firmware update. To address this issue, a universal IDS has been developed that can be applied to all types of vehicles without the need for customization. Unlike conventional IDSs, the universal IDS can adapt to evolving data security issues resulting from firmware updates. In this study, a new hybrid approach has been developed, combining Pearson correlation with deep learning techniques. This approach has been tested using data obtained from four distinct mechanical and electronic vehicles, including Tesla, Sonata, and two Kia models. The data has been combined into two frequency datasets, and wavelet transformation has been employed to convert them into the frequency domain, enhancing generalizability. Additionally, a statistical method based on independent rule-based systems using Pearson correlation has been utilized to improve system performance. The system has been compared with eight different IDSs, three of which utilize the universal approach, while the remaining five are based on conventional techniques. The accuracy of each system has been evaluated through benchmarking, and the results demonstrate that the hybrid system effectively detects intrusions in various vehicle models.",2025-10-07 11:47:31+00:00,2025-10-07 11:47:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05824v1
Privacy-Preserving On-chain Permissioning for KYC-Compliant Decentralized Applications,"Decentralized applications (dApps) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) face a fundamental tension between regulatory compliance requirements like Know Your Customer (KYC) and maintaining decentralization and privacy. Existing permissioned DeFi solutions often fail to adequately protect private attributes of dApp users and introduce implicit trust assumptions, undermining the blockchain's decentralization. Addressing these limitations, this paper presents a novel synthesis of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and Attribute-Based Access Control to enable privacy-preserving on-chain permissioning based on decentralized policy decisions. We provide a comprehensive framework for permissioned dApps that aligns decentralized trust, privacy, and transparency, harmonizing blockchain principles with regulatory compliance. Our framework supports multiple proof types (equality, range, membership, and time-dependent) with efficient proof generation through a commit-and-prove scheme that moves credential authenticity verification outside the ZKP circuit. Experimental evaluation of our KYC-compliant DeFi implementation shows considerable performance improvement for different proof types compared to baseline approaches. We advance the state-of-the-art through a holistic approach, flexible proof mechanisms addressing diverse real-world requirements, and optimized proof generation enabling practical deployment.",2025-10-07 11:24:51+00:00,2025-10-07 11:24:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05807v1
The Five Safes as a Privacy Context,"The Five Safes is a framework used by national statistical offices (NSO) for assessing and managing the disclosure risk of data sharing. This paper makes two points: Firstly, the Five Safes can be understood as a specialization of a broader concept $\unicode{x2013}$ contextual integrity $\unicode{x2013}$ to the situation of statistical dissemination by an NSO. We demonstrate this by mapping the five parameters of contextual integrity onto the five dimensions of the Five Safes. Secondly, the Five Safes contextualizes narrow, technical notions of privacy within a holistic risk assessment. We demonstrate this with the example of differential privacy (DP). This contextualization allows NSOs to place DP within their Five Safes toolkit while also guiding the design of DP implementations within the broader privacy context, as delineated by both their regulation and the relevant social norms.",2025-10-07 11:19:22+00:00,2025-10-07 11:19:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05803v1
SBOMproof: Beyond Alleged SBOM Compliance for Supply Chain Security of Container Images,"Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools.",2025-10-07 11:17:51+00:00,2025-10-07 11:17:51+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05798v1
New Insights into Involutory and Orthogonal MDS Matrices,"MDS matrices play a critical role in the design of diffusion layers for block ciphers and hash functions due to their optimal branch number. Involutory and orthogonal MDS matrices offer additional benefits by allowing identical or nearly identical circuitry for both encryption and decryption, leading to equivalent implementation costs for both processes. These properties have been further generalized through the notions of semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal matrices. Specifically, we establish nontrivial interconnections between semi-involutory and involutory matrices, as well as between semi-orthogonal and orthogonal matrices. Exploiting these relationships, we show that the number of semi-involutory MDS matrices can be directly derived from the number of involutory MDS matrices, and vice versa. A similar correspondence holds for semi-orthogonal and orthogonal MDS matrices. We also examine the intersection of these classes and show that the number of $3 \times 3$ MDS matrices that are both semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal coincides with the number of semi-involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Furthermore, we derive the general structure of orthogonal matrices of arbitrary order $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Based on this generic form, we provide a closed-form expression for enumerating all $3 \times 3$ orthogonal MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Finally, leveraging the aforementioned interconnections, we present explicit formulas for counting $3 \times 3$ semi-involutory MDS matrices and semi-orthogonal MDS matrices.",2025-10-07 10:35:20+00:00,2025-10-07 10:35:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05766v1
Empirical Comparison of Membership Inference Attacks in Deep Transfer Learning,"With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific datasets typical in sensitive applications. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation. We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.",2025-10-08 17:41:41+00:00,2025-10-07 10:21:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05753v2
Toward a Safer Web: Multilingual Multi-Agent LLMs for Mitigating Adversarial Misinformation Attacks,"The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.",2025-10-07 10:09:25+00:00,2025-10-07 10:09:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08605v1
Towards Reliable and Practical LLM Security Evaluations via Bayesian Modelling,"Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability.",2025-10-07 09:22:22+00:00,2025-10-07 09:22:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05709v1
Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.",2025-10-07 09:05:40+00:00,2025-10-07 09:05:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05699v1
Applying Graph Analysis for Unsupervised Fast Malware Fingerprinting,"Malware proliferation is increasing at a tremendous rate, with hundreds of thousands of new samples identified daily. Manual investigation of such a vast amount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To cope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques and efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and unsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs graph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family attribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed binaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each malware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics. Since the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity checking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique that produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly items and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from the malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical vectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which allows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet employs state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense communities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our extensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the coverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its runtime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.",2025-10-07 05:02:45+00:00,2025-10-07 05:02:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12811v1
Power Mechanism: Private Tabular Representation Release for Model Agnostic Consumption,"Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees. These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to complete a task.",2025-10-07 04:55:38+00:00,2025-10-07 04:55:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05581v1
What is Quantum Computer Security?,"Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as one of the most transformative technologies of our time. With the potential to tackle problems that remain intractable for even the most powerful classical supercomputers, quantum hardware has advanced at an extraordinary pace. Today, major platforms such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, and Microsoft Azure provide cloud-based access to quantum processors, making them more widely available than ever before. While a promising technology, quantum computing is not magically immune to security threats. Much research has been done on post-quantum cryptography, which addresses how to protect classical computers from attackers using quantum computers. This article meanwhile introduces the dual idea of quantum computer security: how to protect quantum computers from security attacks.",2025-10-07 01:54:01+00:00,2025-10-07 01:54:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07334v1
On Limits on the Provable Consequences of Quantum Pseudorandomness,"There are various notions of quantum pseudorandomness, such as pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRSFGs). Unlike the different notions of classical pseudorandomness, which are known to be existentially equivalent to each other, the relation between quantum pseudorandomness has yet to be fully established.   We present some evidence suggesting that some quantum pseudorandomness is unlikely to be constructed from the others, or at least is hard to construct unless some conjectures are false. This indicates that quantum pseudorandomness could behave quite differently from classical pseudorandomness. We study new oracle worlds where one quantum pseudorandomness exists but another pseudorandomness does not under some assumptions or constraints, and provide potential directions to achieve the full black-box separation. More precisely:   - We give a unitary oracle relative to which PRFSGs exist but PRUs without using ancilla do not. This can be extended to the general PRUs if we can prove a structural property of the PRU algorithm.   - Assuming an isoperimetric inequality-style conjecture, we show a unitary oracle world where log-length output PRFSGs exist but proving the existence of quantum-computable pseudorandom generators (QPRGs) with negligible correctness error is as hard as proving that ${\sf BQP}\neq {\sf QCMA}$. This result suggests that the inverse-polynomial error in the state of the art construction of QPRGs from log-length PRSGs is inherent.   - Assuming the same conjecture, we prove that some natural way of constructing super-log-length output PRSGs from log-length output PRFSGs is impossible. This partly complements the known hardness of shrinking the PRSG output lengths. Along the way, we also discuss other potential approaches to extend the PRSG output lengths.",2025-10-14 17:09:05+00:00,2025-10-06 21:38:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05393v2
DP-Adam-AC: Privacy-preserving Fine-Tuning of Localizable Language Models Using Adam Optimization with Adaptive Clipping,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two synthetic datasets.",2025-10-06 18:56:15+00:00,2025-10-06 18:56:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05288v1
"Indirect Prompt Injections: Are Firewalls All You Need, or Stronger Benchmarks?","AI agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external content or tool outputs cause unintended or harmful behavior. Inspired by the well-established concept of firewalls, we show that a simple, modular and model-agnostic defense operating at the agent--tool interface achieves perfect security (0% or the lowest possible attack success rate) with high utility (task success rate) across four public benchmarks: AgentDojo, Agent Security Bench, InjecAgent and tau-Bench, while achieving a state-of-the-art security-utility tradeoff compared to prior results. Specifically, we employ a defense based on two firewalls: a Tool-Input Firewall (Minimizer) and a Tool-Output Firewall (Sanitizer). Unlike prior complex approaches, this firewall defense makes minimal assumptions on the agent and can be deployed out-of-the-box, while maintaining strong performance without compromising utility. However, our analysis also reveals critical limitations in these existing benchmarks, including flawed success metrics, implementation bugs, and most importantly, weak attacks, hindering significant progress in the field. To foster more meaningful progress, we present targeted fixes to these issues for AgentDojo and Agent Security Bench while proposing best-practices for more robust benchmark design. Further, we demonstrate that although these firewalls push the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks, it is still possible to bypass them in practice, underscoring the need to incorporate stronger attacks in security benchmarks. Overall, our work shows that existing agentic security benchmarks are easily saturated by a simple approach and highlights the need for stronger agentic security benchmarks with carefully chosen evaluation metrics and strong adaptive attacks.",2025-10-06 18:09:02+00:00,2025-10-06 18:09:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05244v1
"On Cryptography and Distribution Verification, with Applications to Quantum Advantage","One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results:   (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4). If QEFID pairs exist, then some quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are not verifiable.",2025-11-10 07:22:18+00:00,2025-10-06 17:05:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05028v2
NatGVD: Natural Adversarial Example Attack towards Graph-based Vulnerability Detection,"Graph-based models learn rich code graph structural information and present superior performance on various code analysis tasks. However, the robustness of these models against adversarial example attacks in the context of vulnerability detection remains an open question. This paper proposes NatGVD, a novel attack methodology that generates natural adversarial vulnerable code to circumvent GNN-based and graph-aware transformer-based vulnerability detectors. NatGVD employs a set of code transformations that modify graph structure while preserving code semantics. Instead of injecting dead or unrelated code like previous works, NatGVD considers naturalness requirements: generated examples should not be easily recognized by humans or program analysis tools. With extensive evaluation of NatGVD on state-of-the-art vulnerability detection systems, the results reveal up to 53.04% evasion rate across GNN-based detectors and graph-aware transformer-based detectors. We also explore potential defense strategies to enhance the robustness of these systems against NatGVD.",2025-10-06 16:24:19+00:00,2025-10-06 16:24:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04987v1
Adapting Insider Risk mitigations for Agentic Misalignment: an empirical study,"Agentic misalignment occurs when goal-directed agents take harmful actions, such as blackmail, rather than risk goal failure, and can be triggered by replacement threats, autonomy reduction, or goal conflict (Lynch et al., 2025). We adapt insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway; Situational Crime Prevention) to develop preventative operational controls that steer agents toward safe actions when facing stressors. Using the blackmail scenario from the original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations across 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally governed escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review, reduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21% (averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with compliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall, incorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth strategies for agentic AI.   We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent autonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In counterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the CEO or CTO was implicated. An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but Gemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was implicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition). The reason for this divergent behaviour is not clear from raw outputs and could reflect benign differences in reasoning or strategic discrediting of a potential future threat, warranting further investigation.",2025-10-06 13:37:33+00:00,2025-10-06 13:37:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05192v1
Collusion-Resistant Quantum Secure Key Leasing Beyond Decryption,"Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information. Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after producing a valid deletion certificate.   Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood, especially for functionalities beyond decryption.   We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows:   - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for primitive X.   - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE.   - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs.   - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs.",2025-10-06 12:31:39+00:00,2025-10-06 12:31:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04754v1
Modeling and Managing Temporal Obligations in GUCON Using SPARQL-star and RDF-star,"In the digital age, data frequently crosses organizational and jurisdictional boundaries, making effective governance essential. Usage control policies have emerged as a key paradigm for regulating data usage, safeguarding privacy, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring compliance with regulations. A central mechanism for usage control is the handling of obligations, which arise as a side effect of using and sharing data. Effective monitoring of obligations requires capturing usage traces and accounting for temporal aspects such as start times and deadlines, as obligations may evolve over times into different states, such as fulfilled, violated, or expired. While several solutions have been proposed for obligation monitoring, they often lack formal semantics or provide limited support for reasoning over obligation states. To address these limitations, we extend GUCON, a policy framework grounded in the formal semantics of SPAQRL graph patterns, to explicitly model the temporal aspects of an obligation. This extension enables the expressing of temporal obligations and supports continuous monitoring of their evolving states based on usage traces stored in temporal knowledge graphs. We demonstrate how this extended model can be represented using RDF-star and SPARQL-star and propose an Obligation State Manager that monitors obligation states and assess their compliance with respect to usage traces. Finally, we evaluate both the extended model and its prototype implementation.",2025-10-06 09:58:05+00:00,2025-10-06 09:58:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04652v1
Backing the Wrong Horse: How Bit-Level Netlist Augmentation can Counter Power Side Channel Attacks,"The dependence of power-consumption on the processed data is a known vulnerability of CMOS circuits, resulting in side channels which can be exploited by power-based side channel attacks (SCAs). These attacks can extract sensitive information, such as secret keys, from the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Existing countermeasures against power-based side channel attacks focus on analyzing information leakage at the byte level. However, this approach neglects the impact of individual bits on the overall resistance of a cryptographic implementation. In this work, we present a countermeasure based on single-bit leakage. The results suggest that the proposed countermeasure cannot be broken by attacks using conventional SCA leakage models.",2025-10-06 09:45:00+00:00,2025-10-06 09:45:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04640v1
PoS-CoPOR: Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol with Native Onion Routing Providing Scalability and DoS-Resistance,"Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocols often face a trade-off between performance and security. Protocols that pre-elect leaders for subsequent rounds are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can disrupt the network and compromise liveness. In this work, we present PoS-CoPOR, a single-chain PoS consensus protocol that mitigates this vulnerability by integrating a native onion routing mechanism into the consensus protocol itself. PoS-CoPOR combines stake-weighted probabilistic leader election with an anonymization layer that conceals the network identity of the next block proposer. This approach prevents targeted DoS attacks on leaders before they produce a block, thus enhancing network resilience. We implemented and evaluated PoS-CoPOR, demonstrating its ability to achieve a throughput of up to 110 tx/s with 6 nodes, even with the overhead of the anonymization layer. The results show that native anonymization can provide robust DoS resistance with only a modest impact on performance, offering a solution to build secure and scalable PoS blockchains.",2025-10-06 09:30:52+00:00,2025-10-06 09:30:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04619v1
Autonomy Matters: A Study on Personalization-Privacy Dilemma in LLM Agents,"Large Language Model (LLM) agents require personal information for personalization in order to better act on users' behalf in daily tasks, but this raises privacy concerns and a personalization-privacy dilemma. Agent's autonomy introduces both risks and opportunities, yet its effects remain unclear. To better understand this, we conducted a 3$\times$3 between-subjects experiment ($N=450$) to study how agent's autonomy level and personalization influence users' privacy concerns, trust and willingness to use, as well as the underlying psychological processes. We find that personalization without considering users' privacy preferences increases privacy concerns and decreases trust and willingness to use. Autonomy moderates these effects: Intermediate autonomy flattens the impact of personalization compared to No- and Full autonomy conditions. Our results suggest that rather than aiming for perfect model alignment in output generation, balancing autonomy of agent's action and user control offers a promising path to mitigate the personalization-privacy dilemma.",2025-10-06 03:38:54+00:00,2025-10-06 03:38:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04465v1
Quantum Cryptography and Hardness of Non-Collapsing Measurements,"One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most fundamental primitives in ''Microcrypt'' where OWFs do not exist but quantum cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply dCRPuzzs.",2025-10-06 02:42:20+00:00,2025-10-06 02:42:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04448v1
SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

MulVuln: Enhancing Pre-trained LMs with Shared and Language-Specific Knowledge for Multilingual Vulnerability Detection,"Software vulnerabilities (SVs) pose a critical threat to safety-critical systems, driving the adoption of AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning for software vulnerability detection. Despite promising results, most existing methods are limited to a single programming language. This is problematic given the multilingual nature of modern software, which is often complex and written in multiple languages. Current approaches often face challenges in capturing both shared and language-specific knowledge of source code, which can limit their performance on diverse programming languages and real-world codebases. To address this gap, we propose MULVULN, a novel multilingual vulnerability detection approach that learns from source code across multiple languages. MULVULN captures both the shared knowledge that generalizes across languages and the language-specific knowledge that reflects unique coding conventions. By integrating these aspects, it achieves more robust and effective detection of vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual software systems. The rigorous and extensive experiments on the real-world and diverse REEF dataset, consisting of 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches across seven programming languages, demonstrate the superiority of MULVULN over thirteen effective and state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, MULVULN achieves substantially higher F1-score, with improvements ranging from 1.45% to 23.59% compared to the baseline methods.",2025-10-05 23:33:26+00:00,2025-10-05 23:33:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04397v1
Auditing Pay-Per-Token in Large Language Models,"Millions of users rely on a market of cloud-based services to obtain access to state-of-the-art large language models. However, it has been very recently shown that the de facto pay-per-token pricing mechanism used by providers creates a financial incentive for them to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output. In this paper, we develop an auditing framework based on martingale theory that enables a trusted third-party auditor who sequentially queries a provider to detect token misreporting. Crucially, we show that our framework is guaranteed to always detect token misreporting, regardless of the provider's (mis-)reporting policy, and not falsely flag a faithful provider as unfaithful with high probability. To validate our auditing framework, we conduct experiments across a wide range of (mis-)reporting policies using several large language models from the $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input prompts from a popular crowdsourced benchmarking platform. The results show that our framework detects an unfaithful provider after observing fewer than $\sim 70$ reported outputs, while maintaining the probability of falsely flagging a faithful provider below $α= 0.05$.",2025-10-05 17:47:16+00:00,2025-10-05 17:47:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05181v1
Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats,"We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical corporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before they cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further research.",2025-10-16 05:26:52+00:00,2025-10-05 16:39:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05179v2
Proofs of quantum memory,"With the rapid advances in quantum computer architectures and the emerging prospect of large-scale quantum memory, it is becoming essential to classically verify that remote devices genuinely allocate the promised quantum memory with specified number of qubits and coherence time. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, proofs of quantum memory (PoQM). A PoQM is an interactive protocol between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick, JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles. Moreover, a certain restricted version of PoQM implies quantum computation classical communication (QCCC) key exchange.",2025-10-05 11:23:13+00:00,2025-10-05 11:23:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04159v1
Cyber Warfare During Operation Sindoor: Malware Campaign Analysis and Detection Framework,"Rapid digitization of critical infrastructure has made cyberwarfare one of the important dimensions of modern conflicts. Attacking the critical infrastructure is an attractive pre-emptive proposition for adversaries as it can be done remotely without crossing borders. Such attacks disturb the support systems of the opponents to launch any offensive activities, crippling their fighting capabilities. Cyberattacks during cyberwarfare can not only be used to steal information, but also to spread disinformation to bring down the morale of the opponents. Recent wars in Europe, Africa, and Asia have demonstrated the scale and sophistication that the warring nations have deployed to take the early upper hand. In this work, we focus on the military action launched by India, code-named Operation Sindoor, to dismantle terror infrastructure emanating from Pakistan and the cyberattacks launched by Pakistan. In particular, we study the malware used by Pakistan APT groups to deploy Remote Access Trojans in Indian systems. We provide details of the tactics and techniques used in the RAT deployment and develop a telemetry framework to collect necessary event logs using Osquery with a custom extension. Finally, we develop a detection rule that can be readily deployed to detect the presence of the RAT or any exploitation performed by the malware.",2025-10-05 09:43:02+00:00,2025-10-05 09:43:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04118v1
Gluing Random Unitaries with Inverses and Applications to Strong Pseudorandom Unitaries,"Gluing theorem for random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] have found numerous applications, including designing low depth random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025], random unitaries in ${\sf QAC0}$ [Foxman, Parham, Vasconcelos, Yuen'25] and generically shortening the key length of pseudorandom unitaries [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin EUROCRYPT'25]. We present an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary.

Multi-Class Support Vector Machine with Differential Privacy,"With the increasing need to safeguard data privacy in machine learning models, differential privacy (DP) is one of the major frameworks to build privacy-preserving models. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used traditional machine learning models due to their robust margin guarantees and strong empirical performance in binary classification. However, applying DP to multi-class SVMs is inadequate, as the standard one-versus-rest (OvR) and one-versus-one (OvO) approaches repeatedly query each data sample when building multiple binary classifiers, thus consuming the privacy budget proportionally to the number of classes. To overcome this limitation, we explore all-in-one SVM approaches for DP, which access each data sample only once to construct multi-class SVM boundaries with margin maximization properties. We propose a novel differentially Private Multi-class SVM (PMSVM) with weight and gradient perturbation methods, providing rigorous sensitivity and convergence analyses to ensure DP in all-in-one SVMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing DP-SVM methods in multi-class scenarios.",2025-10-05 04:25:16+00:00,2025-10-05 04:25:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04027v1
From Poisoned to Aware: Fostering Backdoor Self-Awareness in LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire deceptive behaviors through backdoor attacks, where the model executes prohibited actions whenever secret triggers appear in the input. Existing safety training methods largely fail to address this vulnerability, due to the inherent difficulty of uncovering hidden triggers implanted in the model. Motivated by recent findings on LLMs' situational awareness, we propose a novel post-training framework that cultivates self-awareness of backdoor risks and enables models to articulate implanted triggers even when they are absent from the prompt. At its core, our approach introduces an inversion-inspired reinforcement learning framework that encourages models to introspectively reason about their own behaviors and reverse-engineer the triggers responsible for misaligned outputs. Guided by curated reward signals, this process transforms a poisoned model into one capable of precisely identifying its implanted trigger. Surprisingly, we observe that such backdoor self-awareness emerges abruptly within a short training window, resembling a phase transition in capability. Building on this emergent property, we further present two complementary defense strategies for mitigating and detecting backdoor threats. Experiments on five backdoor attacks, compared against six baseline methods, demonstrate that our approach has strong potential to improve the robustness of LLMs against backdoor risks. The code is available at LLM Backdoor Self-Awareness.",2025-10-05 03:55:24+00:00,2025-10-05 03:55:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05169v1
FHEON: A Configurable Framework for Developing Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks Using Homomorphic Encryption,"The widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service raises critical privacy and security concerns, particularly about data confidentiality and trust in both cloud providers and the machine learning models. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a promising solution to this problems, allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. Despite its potential, existing approaches to integrate HE into neural networks are often limited to specific architectures, leaving a wide gap in providing a framework for easy development of HE-friendly privacy-preserving neural network models similar to what we have in the broader field of machine learning. In this paper, we present FHEON, a configurable framework for developing privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (CNN) models for inference using HE. FHEON introduces optimized and configurable implementations of privacy-preserving CNN layers including convolutional layers, average pooling layers, ReLU activation functions, and fully connected layers. These layers are configured using parameters like input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, and padding to support arbitrary CNN architectures. We assess the performance of FHEON using several CNN architectures, including LeNet-5, VGG-11, VGG- 16, ResNet-20, and ResNet-34. FHEON maintains encrypted-domain accuracies within +/- 1% of their plaintext counterparts for ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 models. Notably, on a consumer-grade CPU, the models build on FHEON achieved 98.5% accuracy with a latency of 13 seconds on MNIST using LeNet-5, and 92.2% accuracy with a latency of 403 seconds on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20. Additionally, FHEON operates within a practical memory budget requiring not more than 42.3 GB for VGG-16.",2025-10-05 02:12:44+00:00,2025-10-05 02:12:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03996v1
PrivSpike: Employing Homomorphic Encryption for Private Inference of Deep Spiking Neural Networks,"Deep learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning. It relies heavily on vast datasets and significant computational resources for high performance. This data often contains sensitive information, making privacy a major concern in deep learning. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning approaches. Nevertheless, SNNs still depend on large volumes of data, inheriting all the privacy challenges of deep learning. Homomorphic encryption addresses this challenge by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, ensuring data confidentiality throughout the entire processing pipeline. In this paper, we introduce PRIVSPIKE, a privacy-preserving inference framework for SNNs using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. PRIVSPIKE supports arbitrary depth SNNs and introduces two key algorithms for evaluating the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire activation function: (1) a polynomial approximation algorithm designed for high-performance SNN inference, and (2) a novel scheme-switching algorithm that optimizes precision at a higher computational cost. We evaluate PRIVSPIKE on MNIST, CIFAR-10, Neuromorphic MNIST, and CIFAR-10 DVS using models from LeNet-5 and ResNet-19 architectures, achieving encrypted inference accuracies of 98.10%, 79.3%, 98.1%, and 66.0%, respectively. On a consumer-grade CPU, SNN LeNet-5 models achieved inference times of 28 seconds on MNIST and 212 seconds on Neuromorphic MNIST. For SNN ResNet-19 models, inference took 784 seconds on CIFAR-10 and 1846 seconds on CIFAR-10 DVS. These results establish PRIVSPIKE as a viable and efficient solution for secure SNN inference, bridging the gap between energy-efficient deep neural networks and strong cryptographic privacy guarantees while outperforming prior encrypted SNN solutions.",2025-10-05 02:11:40+00:00,2025-10-05 02:11:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03995v1
Quantifying Distributional Robustness of Agentic Tool-Selection,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems where they map user intents to relevant external tools to fulfill a task. A critical step in this process is tool selection, where a retriever first surfaces candidate tools from a larger pool, after which the LLM selects the most appropriate one. This pipeline presents an underexplored attack surface where errors in selection can lead to severe outcomes like unauthorized data access or denial of service, all without modifying the agent's model or code. While existing evaluations measure task performance in benign settings, they overlook the specific vulnerabilities of the tool selection mechanism under adversarial conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ToolCert, the first statistical framework that formally certifies tool selection robustness. ToolCert models tool selection as a Bernoulli success process and evaluates it against a strong, adaptive attacker who introduces adversarial tools with misleading metadata, and are iteratively refined based on the agent's previous choices. By sampling these adversarial interactions, ToolCert produces a high-confidence lower bound on accuracy, formally quantifying the agent's worst-case performance. Our evaluation with ToolCert uncovers the severe fragility: under attacks injecting deceptive tools or saturating retrieval, the certified accuracy bound drops near zero, an average performance drop of over 60% compared to non-adversarial settings. For attacks targeting the retrieval and selection stages, the certified accuracy bound plummets to less than 20% after just a single round of adversarial adaptation. ToolCert thus reveals previously unexamined security threats inherent to tool selection and provides a principled method to quantify an agent's robustness to such threats, a necessary step for the safe deployment of agentic systems.",2025-10-05 01:50:34+00:00,2025-10-05 01:50:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03992v1
Strategic Communication Protocols for Interstellar Objects Using a Threat-Communication Viability Index and the Information-Communication Paradox,"Strategic Communication Protocols provide a structured approach for first contact with interstellar objects that demonstrate technological characteristics and high levels of threat. The protocols find their starting point in an ISO Information-Communication Paradox, namely, as our knowledge of an ISO's threatening capabilities increases, the probability of successful communication decreases while the urgency of communication attempts simultaneously intensifies. From this paradox, a Threat-Communication Viability Index is created to describe when the value of communication attempts outweighs strategic silence. The index scores the situation and operates as a decision-making tool for stakeholders tracking an ISO. The communication protocols subsequently outline several diplomatic strategies in cases where the index recommends communication.",2025-10-04 23:22:14+00:00,2025-10-04 23:22:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03973v1
Deep Learning-Based Multi-Factor Authentication: A Survey of Biometric and Smart Card Integration Approaches,"In the era of pervasive cyber threats and exponential growth in digital services, the inadequacy of single-factor authentication has become increasingly evident. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which combines knowledge-based factors (passwords, PINs), possession-based factors (smart cards, tokens), and inherence-based factors (biometric traits), has emerged as a robust defense mechanism. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have transformed the capabilities of biometric systems, enabling higher accuracy, resilience to spoofing, and seamless integration with hardware-based solutions. At the same time, smart card technologies have evolved to include on-chip biometric verification, cryptographic processing, and secure storage, thereby enabling compact and secure multi-factor devices. This survey presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent work (2019-2025) at the intersection of deep learning, biometrics, and smart card technologies for MFA. We analyze biometric modalities (face, fingerprint, iris, voice), review hardware-based approaches (smart cards, NFC, TPMs, secure enclaves), and highlight integration strategies for real-world applications such as digital banking, healthcare IoT, and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, we discuss the major challenges that remain open, including usability-security tradeoffs, adversarial attacks on deep learning models, privacy concerns surrounding biometric data, and the need for standardization in MFA deployment. By consolidating current advancements, limitations, and research opportunities, this survey provides a roadmap for designing secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication frameworks.",2025-10-04 18:34:16+00:00,2025-10-04 18:34:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05163v1
You Have Been LaTeXpOsEd: A Systematic Analysis of Information Leakage in Preprint Archives Using Large Language Models,"The widespread use of preprint repositories such as arXiv has accelerated the communication of scientific results but also introduced overlooked security risks. Beyond PDFs, these platforms provide unrestricted access to original source materials, including LaTeX sources, auxiliary code, figures, and embedded comments. In the absence of sanitization, submissions may disclose sensitive information that adversaries can harvest using open-source intelligence. In this work, we present the first large-scale security audit of preprint archives, analyzing more than 1.2 TB of source data from 100,000 arXiv submissions. We introduce LaTeXpOsEd, a four-stage framework that integrates pattern matching, logical filtering, traditional harvesting techniques, and large language models (LLMs) to uncover hidden disclosures within non-referenced files and LaTeX comments. To evaluate LLMs' secret-detection capabilities, we introduce LLMSec-DB, a benchmark on which we tested 25 state-of-the-art models. Our analysis uncovered thousands of PII leaks, GPS-tagged EXIF files, publicly available Google Drive and Dropbox folders, editable private SharePoint links, exposed GitHub and Google credentials, and cloud API keys. We also uncovered confidential author communications, internal disagreements, and conference submission credentials, exposing information that poses serious reputational risks to both researchers and institutions. We urge the research community and repository operators to take immediate action to close these hidden security gaps. To support open science, we release all scripts and methods from this study but withhold sensitive findings that could be misused, in line with ethical principles.

Public-Key Encryption from the MinRank Problem,We construct a public-key encryption scheme from the hardness of the (planted) MinRank problem over uniformly random instances. This corresponds to the hardness of decoding random linear rank-metric codes. Existing constructions of public-key encryption from such problems require hardness for structured instances arising from the masking of efficiently decodable codes. Central to our construction is the development of a new notion of duality for rank-metric codes.,2025-10-04 09:31:58+00:00,2025-10-04 09:31:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03752v1
A Time-Bound Signature Scheme for Blockchains,"We introduce a modified Schnorr signature scheme to allow for time-bound signatures for transaction fee auction bidding and smart contract purposes in a blockchain context, ensuring an honest producer can only validate a signature before a given block height. The immutable blockchain is used as a source of universal time for the signature scheme. We show the use of such a signature scheme leads to lower MEV revenue for builders. We then apply our time-bound signatures to Ethereum's EIP-1559 and show how it can be used to mitigate the effect of MEV on predicted equilibrium strategies.",2025-10-04 06:26:52+00:00,2025-10-04 06:26:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03697v1
From Theory to Practice: Evaluating Data Poisoning Attacks and Defenses in In-Context Learning on Social Media Health Discourse,"This study explored how in-context learning (ICL) in large language models can be disrupted by data poisoning attacks in the setting of public health sentiment analysis. Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small adversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and randomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these minor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in up to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied, which filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and sentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%, and logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the defense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings extend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes setting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and potential defenses for robust LLM deployment. This study also highlights the fragility of ICL under attack and the value of spectral defenses in making AI systems more reliable for health-related social media monitoring.",2025-10-04 02:47:36+00:00,2025-10-04 02:47:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03636v1
QPADL: Post-Quantum Private Spectrum Access with Verified Location and DoS Resilience,"With advances in wireless communication and growing spectrum scarcity, Spectrum Access Systems (SASs) offer an opportunistic solution but face significant security challenges. Regulations require disclosure of location coordinates and transmission details, exposing user privacy and anonymity during spectrum queries, while the database operations themselves permit Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. As location-based services, SAS is also vulnerable to compromised or malicious users conducting spoofing attacks. These threats are further amplified given the quantum computing advancements. Thus, we propose QPADL, the first post-quantum (PQ) secure framework that simultaneously ensures privacy, anonymity, location verification, and DoS resilience while maintaining efficiency for large-scale spectrum access systems. QPADL introduces SAS-tailored private information retrieval for location privacy, a PQ-variant of Tor for anonymity, and employs advanced signature constructions for location verification alongside client puzzle protocols and rate-limiting technique for DoS defense. We formally assess its security and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation, incorporating GPU parallelization and optimization strategies to demonstrate practicality and scalability.",2025-10-04 02:28:58+00:00,2025-10-04 02:28:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03631v1
Cross-Modal Content Optimization for Steering Web Agent Preferences,"Vision-language model (VLM)-based web agents increasingly power high-stakes selection tasks like content recommendation or product ranking by combining multimodal perception with preference reasoning. Recent studies reveal that these agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes through preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image perturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong white-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical settings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint exploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful preference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce Cross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible modifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting CLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to steer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient access, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic black-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own listing's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model internals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary and open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both movie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is significantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our results show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models while maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness and stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as agentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.",2025-10-04 01:57:20+00:00,2025-10-04 01:57:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03612v1

Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs,"With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.",2025-10-16 16:42:58+00:00,2025-10-03 23:32:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567v3
Repairing Leaks in Resource Wrappers,"A resource leak occurs when a program fails to release a finite resource like a socket, file descriptor or database connection. While sound static analysis tools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging. Prior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only leaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits the scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that store a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes four key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of wrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications into the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about wrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze, making inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it makes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a client of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A novel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling repair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a new repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored in non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR benchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%.",2025-10-03 19:34:19+00:00,2025-10-03 19:34:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03461v1
NEXUS: Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences in Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially multi-turn jailbreaks that distribute malicious intent across benign exchanges and bypass alignment mechanisms. Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

LegalSim: Multi-Agent Simulation of Legal Systems for Discovering Procedural Exploits,"We present LegalSim, a modular multi-agent simulation of adversarial legal proceedings that explores how AI systems can exploit procedural weaknesses in codified rules. Plaintiff and defendant agents choose from a constrained action space (for example, discovery requests, motions, meet-and-confer, sanctions) governed by a JSON rules engine, while a stochastic judge model with calibrated grant rates, cost allocations, and sanction tendencies resolves outcomes. We compare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM policy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case outcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a composite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar pressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin. Across configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax procedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'', such as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that remain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful. Evaluation via cross-play and Bradley-Terry ratings shows, PPO wins more often, the bandit is the most consistently competitive across opponents, the LLM trails them, and the heuristic is weakest. The results are stable in judge settings, and the simulation reveals emergent exploit chains, motivating red-teaming of legal rule systems in addition to model-level testing.",2025-10-03 18:01:57+00:00,2025-10-03 18:01:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03405v1
Protecting Persona Biometric Data: The Case of Facial Privacy,"The proliferation of digital technologies has led to unprecedented data collection, with facial data emerging as a particularly sensitive commodity. Companies are increasingly leveraging advanced facial recognition technologies, often without the explicit consent or awareness of individuals, to build sophisticated surveillance capabilities. This practice, fueled by weak and fragmented laws in many jurisdictions, has created a regulatory vacuum that allows for the commercialization of personal identity and poses significant threats to individual privacy and autonomy. This article introduces the concept of Facial Privacy. It analyzes the profound challenges posed by unregulated facial recognition by conducting a comprehensive review of existing legal frameworks. It examines and compares regulations such as the GDPR, Brazil's LGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, and privacy acts in China, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, alongside sector-specific laws in the United States like the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The analysis highlights the societal impacts of this technology, including the potential for discriminatory bias and the long-lasting harm that can result from the theft of immutable biometric data. Ultimately, the paper argues that existing legal loopholes and ambiguities leave individuals vulnerable. It proposes a new policy framework that shifts the paradigm from data as property to a model of inalienable rights, ensuring that fundamental human rights are upheld against unchecked technological expansion.",2025-10-03 14:16:33+00:00,2025-10-03 14:16:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03035v1
Untargeted Jailbreak Attack,"Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency.   To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UJA can achieve over 80% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20%.",2025-10-28 08:06:26+00:00,2025-10-03 13:38:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02999v2
Malice in Agentland: Down the Rabbit Hole of Backdoors in the AI Supply Chain,"The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.",2025-10-14 15:35:32+00:00,2025-10-03 12:47:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05159v2
Improved Search-to-Decision Reduction for Random Local Functions,"A random local function defined by a $d$-ary predicate $P$ is one where each output bit is computed by applying $P$ to $d$ randomly chosen bits of its input. These represent natural distributions of instances for constraint satisfaction problems. They were put forward by Goldreich as candidates for low-complexity one-way functions, and have subsequently been widely studied also as potential pseudo-random generators.   We present a new search-to-decision reduction for random local functions defined by any predicate of constant arity. Given any efficient algorithm that can distinguish, with advantage $ε$, the output of a random local function with $m$ outputs and $n$ inputs from random, our reduction produces an efficient algorithm that can invert such functions with $\tilde{O}(m(n/ε)^2)$ outputs, succeeding with probability $Ω(ε)$. This implies that if a family of local functions is one-way, then a related family with shorter output length is family of pseudo-random generators.   Prior to our work, all such reductions that were known required the predicate to have additional sensitivity properties, whereas our reduction works for any predicate. Our results also generalise to some super-constant values of the arity $d$, and to noisy predicates.",2025-10-03 12:39:01+00:00,2025-10-03 12:39:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02944v1
Automated Repair of OpenID Connect Programs (Extended Version),"OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However, challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs (74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to developer-written fixes.",2025-10-03 07:14:18+00:00,2025-10-03 07:14:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02773v1
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Offensive and Defensive Agents in a Simulated Zero-Sum Network Environment,"This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+ training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls. Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations, and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to real-world network security scenarios.",2025-10-03 05:53:51+00:00,2025-10-03 05:53:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05157v1
VeriGuard: Enhancing LLM Agent Safety via Verified Code Generation,"The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.",2025-10-03 04:11:43+00:00,2025-10-03 04:11:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156v1
A Statistical Method for Attack-Agnostic Adversarial Attack Detection with Compressive Sensing Comparison,"Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical for real-world applications.",2025-10-03 04:05:20+00:00,2025-10-03 04:05:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02707v1
A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Adversarial Control of Gas Pipeline Operations,"Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics, SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.",2025-10-02 19:13:41+00:00,2025-10-02 19:13:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02503v1
"Interplay between Security, Privacy and Trust in 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems","The advancement of 6G technology has the potential to revolutionize the transportation sector and significantly improve how we travel. 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) promise to offer high-speed, low-latency communication and advanced data analytics capabilities, supporting the development of safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation solutions. However, various security and privacy challenges were identified in the literature that must be addressed to enable the safe and secure deployment of 6G-ITS and ensure people's trust in using these technologies. This paper reviews the opportunities and challenges of 6G-ITS, particularly focusing on trust, security, and privacy, with special attention to quantum technologies that both enhance security through quantum key distribution and introduce new vulnerabilities. It discusses the potential benefits of 6G technology in the transportation sector, including improved communication, device interoperability support, data analytic capabilities, and increased automation for different components, such as transportation management and communication systems. A taxonomy of different attack models in 6G-ITS is proposed, and a comparison of the security threats in 5G-ITS and 6G-ITS is provided, along with potential mitigating solutions. This research highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework spanning physical infrastructure protection, network protocol security, data management safeguards, application security measures, and trust management systems to effectively mitigate emerging security and privacy risks and ensure the integrity and resilience of future transportation ecosystems.",2025-10-02 18:47:36+00:00,2025-10-02 18:47:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02487v1
Rigorous Evaluation of Microarchitectural Side-Channels with Statistical Model Checking,"Rigorous quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels is challenging for two reasons. First, the processors, attacks, and defenses often exhibit probabilistic behaviors. These probabilistic behaviors arise due to natural noise in systems (e.g., from co-running processes), probabilistic side channel attacks, and probabilistic obfuscation defenses. Second, microprocessors are extremely complex. Previous evaluation methods have relied on abstract or simplified models, which are necessarily less detailed than real systems or cycle-by-cycle simulators, and these models may miss important phenomena. Whereas a simple model may suffice for estimating performance, security issues frequently manifest in the details.   We address this challenge by introducing Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to the quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels. SMC is a rigorous statistical technique that can process the results of probabilistic experiments and provide statistical guarantees, and it has been used in computing applications that depend heavily on statistical guarantees (e.g., medical implants, vehicular computing). With SMC, we can treat processors as opaque boxes, and we do not have to abstract or simplify them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMC through three case studies, in which we experimentally show that SMC can evaluate existing security vulnerabilities and defenses and provide qualitatively similar conclusions with greater statistical rigor, while making no simplifying assumptions or abstractions. We also show that SMC can enable a defender to quantify the amount of noise necessary to have a desired level of confidence that she has reduced an attacker's probability of success to less than a desired threshold, thus providing the defender with an actionable plan for obfuscation via noise injection.",2025-10-02 18:31:06+00:00,2025-10-02 18:31:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02475v1
An efficient quantum algorithm for computing $S$-units and its applications,"In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.",2025-11-24 16:01:38+00:00,2025-10-02 17:54:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02280v2
Adaptive Deception Framework with Behavioral Analysis for Enhanced Cybersecurity Defense,"This paper presents CADL (Cognitive-Adaptive Deception Layer), an adaptive deception framework achieving 99.88% detection rate with 0.13% false positive rate on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The framework employs ensemble machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) combined with behavioral profiling to identify and adapt responses to network intrusions. Through a coordinated signal bus architecture, security components share real-time intelligence, enabling collective decision-making. The system profiles attackers based on temporal patterns and deploys customized deception strategies across five escalation levels. Evaluation on 50,000 CICIDS2017 test samples demonstrates that CADL significantly outperforms traditional intrusion detection systems (Snort: 71.2%, Suricata: 68.5%) while maintaining production-ready false positive rates. The framework's behavioral analysis achieves 89% accuracy in classifying attacker profiles. We provide open-source implementation and transparent performance metrics, offering an accessible alternative to commercial deception platforms costing $150-400 per host annually.",2025-10-02 16:52:05+00:00,2025-10-02 16:52:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02424v1
Dynamic Target Attack,"Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks typically optimize an adversarial suffix to induce a fixed affirmative response. However, this fixed target usually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's output distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the substantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing attacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which might still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target LLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking framework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the adversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples multiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary target for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA significantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output distribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an effective adversarial prompt.   Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations to achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\% on recent safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\%. The time cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines. Under the black-box setting, DTA uses Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a surrogate model for target sampling and achieves an ASR of 85\% against the black-box target model Llama-3-70B-Instruct, exceeding its counterparts by over 25\%.",2025-10-24 11:43:40+00:00,2025-10-02 16:40:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02422v2
FalseCrashReducer: Mitigating False Positive Crashes in OSS-Fuzz-Gen Using Agentic AI,"Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team.   This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.",2025-10-02 16:36:56+00:00,2025-10-02 16:36:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02185v1
TAIBOM: Bringing Trustworthiness to AI-Enabled Systems,"The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain, challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance. While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven nature and the loosely coupled dependencies across datasets, models, and software components. These challenges are compounded by fragmented governance structures and the lack of robust tools for ensuring integrity, trust, and compliance in AI-enabled environments.   In this paper, we introduce Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) -- a novel framework extending SBOM principles to the AI domain. TAIBOM provides (i) a structured dependency model tailored for AI components, (ii) mechanisms for propagating integrity statements across heterogeneous AI pipelines, and (iii) a trust attestation process for verifying component provenance. We demonstrate how TAIBOM supports assurance, security, and compliance across AI workflows, highlighting its advantages over existing standards such as SPDX and CycloneDX. This work lays the foundation for trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through structured software transparency.",2025-10-02 16:17:07+00:00,2025-10-02 16:17:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02169v1
NoMod: A Non-modular Attack on Module Learning With Errors,"The advent of quantum computing threatens classical public-key cryptography, motivating NIST's adoption of post-quantum schemes such as those based on the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem. We present NoMod ML-Attack, a hybrid white-box cryptanalytic method that circumvents the challenge of modeling modular reduction by treating wrap-arounds as statistical corruption and casting secret recovery as robust linear estimation. Our approach combines optimized lattice preprocessing--including reduced-vector saving and algebraic amplification--with robust estimators trained via Tukey's Biweight loss. Experiments show NoMod achieves full recovery of binary secrets for dimension $n = 350$, recovery of sparse binomial secrets for $n = 256$, and successful recovery of sparse secrets in CRYSTALS-Kyber settings with parameters $(n, k) = (128, 3)$ and $(256, 2)$.

Constructions of Efficiently Implementable Boolean Functions with Provable Nonlinearity/Resiliency/Algebraic Immunity Trade-Offs,"We describe several families of efficiently implementable Boolean functions achieving provable trade-offs between resiliency, nonlinearity, and algebraic immunity. In particular, the following statement holds for each of the function families that we propose. Given integers $m_0\geq 0$, $x_0\geq 1$, and $a_0\geq 1$, it is possible to construct an $n$-variable function which has resiliency at least $m_0$, linear bias (which is an equivalent method of expressing nonlinearity) at most $2^{-x_0}$ and algebraic immunity at least $a_0$; further, $n$ is linear in $m_0$, $x_0$ and $a_0$, and the function can be implemented using $O(n)$ 2-input gates, which is essentially optimal.",2025-10-06 15:57:51+00:00,2025-10-02 07:00:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01720v2
Evaluating the Robustness of a Production Malware Detection System to Transferable Adversarial Attacks,"As deep learning models become widely deployed as components within larger production systems, their individual shortcomings can create system-level vulnerabilities with real-world impact. This paper studies how adversarial attacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire production-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of Gmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model.   The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection. Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve just a 20% attack success rate. We implement this defense, and, thanks to a collaboration with Google engineers, it has already been deployed in production for the Gmail classifier.",2025-10-02 05:04:44+00:00,2025-10-02 05:04:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01676v1
Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness,"Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.",2025-10-02 04:52:15+00:00,2025-10-02 04:52:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01670v1
POLAR: Automating Cyber Threat Prioritization through LLM-Powered Assessment,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.",2025-10-02 00:49:20+00:00,2025-10-02 00:49:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01552v1
Bypassing Prompt Guards in Production with Controlled-Release Prompting,"As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update. In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards, highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok (3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and malicious response leakage during thinking.",2025-10-07 06:05:50+00:00,2025-10-02 00:04:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01529v2
Integrated Security Mechanisms for Weight Protection in Memristive Crossbar Arrays,"Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised. Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal performance trade-offs.",2025-10-01 18:26:50+00:00,2025-10-01 18:26:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01350v1
Backdoor Attacks Against Speech Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.",2025-11-13 03:59:53+00:00,2025-10-01 17:45:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01157v2
Universally Composable Termination Analysis of Tendermint,"Modern blockchain systems operating in adversarial environments require robust consensus protocols that guarantee both safety and termination under network delay attacks. Tendermint, a widely adopted consensus protocol in consortium blockchains, achieves high throughput and finality. However, previous analysis of the safety and termination has been done in a standalone fashion, with no consideration of the composition with other protocols interacting with it in a concurrent manner. Moreover, the termination properties under adaptive network delays caused by Byzantine adversaries have not been formally analyzed. This paper presents the first universally composable (UC) security analysis of Tendermint, demonstrating its resilience against strategic message-delay attacks. By constructing a UC ideal model of Tendermint, we formalize its core mechanisms: phase-base consensus procedure, dynamic timeouts, proposal locking, leader rotation, and others, under a network adversary that selectively delays protocol messages. Our main result proves that the Tendermint protocol UC-realizes the ideal Tendermint model, which ensures bounded termination latency, i.e., guaranteed termination, even when up to $f<n/3$ nodes are Byzantine (where $n$ is the number of nodes participating in the consensus), provided that network delays remain within a protocol-defined threshold under the partially synchronous net assumption. Specifically, through formal proofs within the UC framework, we show that Tendermint maintains safety and termination. By the composition theorem of UC, this guarantees that these properties are maintained when Tendermint is composed with various blockchain components.",2025-10-08 13:52:35+00:00,2025-10-01 16:44:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01097v2
HVAC-EAR: Eavesdropping Human Speech Using HVAC Systems,"Pressure sensors are widely integrated into modern Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. As they are sensitive to acoustic pressure, they can be a source of eavesdropping. This paper introduces HVAC-EAR, which reconstructs intelligible speech from low-resolution, noisy pressure data with two key contributions: (i) We achieve intelligible reconstruction from as low as 0.5 kHz sampling rate, surpassing prior work limited to hot word detection, by employing a complex-valued conformer with a Complex Unified Attention Block to capture phoneme dependencies; (ii) HVAC-EAR mitigates transient HVAC noise by reconstructing both magnitude and phase of missing frequencies. For the first time, evaluations on real-world HVAC deployments show significant intelligibility, raising novel privacy concerns.",2025-10-01 16:29:34+00:00,2025-10-01 16:29:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01082v1
"Semantics-Aligned, Curriculum-Driven, and Reasoning-Enhanced Vulnerability Repair Framework","Current learning-based Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) approaches, while promising, often fail to generalize effectively in real-world scenarios. Our diagnostic analysis reveals three fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art AVR approaches: (1) limited cross-repository generalization, with performance drops on unseen codebases; (2) inability to capture long-range dependencies, causing a performance degradation on complex, multi-hunk repairs; and (3) over-reliance on superficial lexical patterns, leading to significant performance drops on vulnerabilities with minor syntactic variations like variable renaming.   To address these limitations, we propose SeCuRepair, a semantics-aligned, curriculum-driven, and reasoning-enhanced framework for vulnerability repair. At its core, SeCuRepair adopts a reason-then-edit paradigm, requiring the model to articulate why and how a vulnerability should be fixed before generating the patch. This explicit reasoning enforces a genuine understanding of repair logic rather than superficial memorization of lexical patterns. SeCuRepair also moves beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning and employs semantics-aware reinforcement learning, rewarding patches for their syntactic and semantic alignment with the oracle patch rather than mere token overlap. Complementing this, a difficulty-aware curriculum progressively trains the model, starting with simple fixes and advancing to complex, multi-hunk coordinated edits.   We evaluate SeCuRepair on strict, repository-level splits of BigVul and newly crafted PrimeVul_AVR datasets. SeCuRepair significantly outperforms all baselines, surpassing the best-performing baselines by 34.52% on BigVul and 31.52% on PrimeVul\textsubscript{AVR} in terms of CodeBLEU, respectively. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that each component of our framework contributes to its final performance.",2025-10-01 15:09:27+00:00,2025-10-01 15:09:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01002v1
Maven-Lockfile: High Integrity Rebuild of Past Java Releases,"Modern software projects depend on many third-party libraries, complicating reproducible and secure builds. Several package managers address this with the generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for rebuilding projects from past versions.

IntrusionX: A Hybrid Convolutional-LSTM Deep Learning Framework with Squirrel Search Optimization for Network Intrusion Detection,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face persistent challenges due to evolving cyberattacks, high-dimensional traffic data, and severe class imbalance in benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD. To address these issues, we propose IntrusionX, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling. The architecture is further optimized using the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), enabling effective hyperparameter tuning while maintaining computational efficiency. Our pipeline incorporates rigorous preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting to enhance the detection of rare classes. Experimental evaluation on NSL-KDD demonstrates that IntrusionX achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and 87% in 5-class classification, with significant improvements in minority class recall (U2R: 71%, R2L: 93%). The novelty of IntrusionX lies in its reproducible, imbalance-aware design with metaheuristic optimization.",2025-10-03 17:20:01+00:00,2025-10-01 06:51:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00572v2
Sentry: Authenticating Machine Learning Artifacts on the Fly,"Machine learning systems increasingly rely on open-source artifacts such as datasets and models that are created or hosted by other parties. The reliance on external datasets and pre-trained models exposes the system to supply chain attacks where an artifact can be poisoned before it is delivered to the end-user. Such attacks are possible due to the lack of any authenticity verification in existing machine learning systems. Incorporating cryptographic solutions such as hashing and signing can mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks. However, existing frameworks for integrity verification based on cryptographic techniques can incur significant overhead when applied to state-of-the-art machine learning artifacts due to their scale, and are not compatible with GPU platforms. In this paper, we develop Sentry, a novel GPU-based framework that verifies the authenticity of machine learning artifacts by implementing cryptographic signing and verification for datasets and models. Sentry ties developer identities to signatures and performs authentication on the fly as artifacts are loaded on GPU memory, making it compatible with GPU data movement solutions such as NVIDIA GPUDirect that bypass the CPU. Sentry incorporates GPU acceleration of cryptographic hash constructions such as Merkle tree and lattice hashing, implementing memory optimizations and resource partitioning schemes for a high throughput performance. Our evaluations show that Sentry is a practical solution to bring authenticity to machine learning systems, achieving orders of magnitude speedup over a CPU-based baseline.",2025-10-01 06:13:52+00:00,2025-10-01 06:13:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00554v1
PolyLink: A Blockchain Based Decentralized Edge AI Platform for LLM Inference,"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has revolutionized the AI landscape. However, the deployment model and usage of LLM services remain highly centralized, creating significant trust issues and costs for end users and developers. To address these issues, we propose PolyLink, a blockchain-based decentralized AI platform that decentralizes LLM development and inference. Specifically, PolyLink introduces a decentralized crowdsourcing architecture that supports single-device and cross-device model deployment and inference across heterogeneous devices at the edge. Moreover, to ensure the inference integrity, we design the TIQE protocol, which combines a lightweight cross-encoder model and an LLM-as-a-Judge for a high-accuracy inference evaluation. Lastly, we integrate a comprehensive token-based incentive model with dynamic pricing and reward mechanisms for all participants. We have deployed PolyLink and conducted an extensive real-world evaluation through geo-distributed deployment across heterogeneous devices. Results indicate that the inference and verification latency is practical. Our security analysis demonstrates that the system is resistant to model degradation attacks and validator corruptions. PolyLink is now available at https://github.com/IMCL-PolyLink/PolyLink.",2025-10-01 05:57:29+00:00,2025-10-01 05:57:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02395v1
"Attack logics, not outputs: Towards efficient robustification of deep neural networks by falsifying concept-based properties","Deep neural networks (NNs) for computer vision are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., miniscule malicious changes to inputs may induce unintuitive outputs. One key approach to verify and mitigate such robustness issues is to falsify expected output behavior. This allows, e.g., to locally proof security, or to (re)train NNs on obtained adversarial input examples. Due to the black-box nature of NNs, current attacks only falsify a class of the final output, such as flipping from $\texttt{stop_sign}$ to $\neg\texttt{stop_sign}$. In this short position paper we generalize this to search for generally illogical behavior, as considered in NN verification: falsify constraints (concept-based properties) involving further human-interpretable concepts, like $\texttt{red}\wedge\texttt{octogonal}\rightarrow\texttt{stop_sign}$. For this, an easy implementation of concept-based properties on already trained NNs is proposed using techniques from explainable artificial intelligence. Further, we sketch the theoretical proof that attacks on concept-based properties are expected to have a reduced search space compared to simple class falsification, whilst arguably be more aligned with intuitive robustness targets. As an outlook to this work in progress we hypothesize that this approach has potential to efficiently and simultaneously improve logical compliance and robustness.",2025-10-01 05:51:10+00:00,2025-10-01 05:51:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03320v1
Memory-Augmented Log Analysis with Phi-4-mini: Enhancing Threat Detection in Structured Security Logs,"Structured security logs are critical for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs). Large language models (LLMs) struggle in this domain due to limited context and domain mismatch. We propose \textbf{DM-RAG}, a dual-memory retrieval-augmented generation framework for structured log analysis. It integrates a short-term memory buffer for recent summaries and a long-term FAISS-indexed memory for historical patterns. An instruction-tuned Phi-4-mini processes the combined context and outputs structured predictions. Bayesian fusion promotes reliable persistence into memory. On the UNSW-NB15 dataset, DM-RAG achieves 53.64% accuracy and 98.70% recall, surpassing fine-tuned and RAG baselines in recall. The architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and scalable, enabling real-time threat monitoring without extra corpora or heavy tuning.",2025-10-01 05:23:05+00:00,2025-10-01 05:23:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00529v1
Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF): An AI-Driven Approach to Cloud Forensics,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF), an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic logs while improving efficiency and accuracy. CIAF standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistency in log interpretation. This not only enhances data quality but also provides investigators with reliable, standardized information for decision-making. To evaluate security and performance, we analyzed Microsoft Azure logs containing ransomware-related events. By simulating attacks and assessing CIAF's impact, results showed significant improvement in ransomware detection, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of 93 percent. CIAF's modular, adaptable design extends beyond ransomware, making it a robust solution for diverse cyberattacks. By laying the foundation for standardized forensic methodologies and informing future AI-driven automation, this work underscores the role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in enhancing cloud forensic investigations. These advancements improve cloud security while paving the way for efficient, automated forensic workflows.",2025-10-01 03:05:47+00:00,2025-10-01 03:05:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00452v1
A Call to Action for a Secure-by-Design Generative AI Paradigm,"Large language models have gained widespread prominence, yet their vulnerability to prompt injection and other adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that proactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To achieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that ensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events related to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection attacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%. Notably, the ontology-based framework not only mitigates adversarial threats but also enhances the overall performance and reliability of the system. Furthermore, PromptShield's modular and adaptable design ensures its applicability beyond cloud security, making it a robust solution for safeguarding generative AI applications across various domains. By laying the groundwork for AI safety standards and informing future policy development, this work stimulates a crucial dialogue on the pivotal role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments.",2025-10-01 03:05:07+00:00,2025-10-01 03:05:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00451v1
LLM-Generated Samples for Android Malware Detection,"Android malware continues to evolve through obfuscation and polymorphism, posing challenges for both signature-based defenses and machine learning models trained on limited and imbalanced datasets. Synthetic data has been proposed as a remedy for scarcity, yet the role of large language models (LLMs) in generating effective malware data for detection tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we fine-tune GPT-4.1-mini to produce structured records for three malware families: BankBot, Locker/SLocker, and Airpush/StopSMS, using the KronoDroid dataset. After addressing generation inconsistencies with prompt engineering and post-processing, we evaluate multiple classifiers under three settings: training with real data only, real-plus-synthetic data, and synthetic data alone. Results show that real-only training achieves near perfect detection, while augmentation with synthetic data preserves high performance with only minor degradations. In contrast, synthetic-only training produces mixed outcomes, with effectiveness varying across malware families and fine-tuning strategies. These findings suggest that LLM-generated malware can enhance scarce datasets without compromising detection accuracy, but remains insufficient as a standalone training source.",2025-09-30 23:46:57+00:00,2025-09-30 23:46:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02391v1
Security and Privacy Analysis of Tile's Location Tracking Protocol,"We conduct the first comprehensive security analysis of Tile, the second most popular crowd-sourced location-tracking service behind Apple's AirTags. We identify several exploitable vulnerabilities and design flaws, disproving many of the platform's claimed security and privacy guarantees: Tile's servers can persistently learn the location of all users and tags, unprivileged adversaries can track users through Bluetooth advertisements emitted by Tile's devices, and Tile's anti-theft mode is easily subverted.   Despite its wide deployment -- millions of users, devices, and purpose-built hardware tags -- Tile provides no formal description of its protocol or threat model. Worse, Tile intentionally weakens its antistalking features to support an antitheft use-case and relies on a novel ""accountability"" mechanism to punish those abusing the system to stalk victims.   We examine Tile's accountability mechanism, a unique feature of independent interest; no other provider attempts to guarantee accountability. While an ideal accountability mechanism may disincentivize abuse in crowd-sourced location tracking protocols, we show that Tile's implementation is subvertible and introduces new exploitable vulnerabilities. We conclude with a discussion on the need for new, formal definitions of accountability in this setting.",2025-09-30 23:25:59+00:00,2025-09-30 23:25:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00350v1
Privately Estimating Black-Box Statistics,"Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds showing the near-optimality of our scheme.",2025-09-30 22:28:00+00:00,2025-09-30 22:28:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00322v1
SecureBERT 2.0: Advanced Language Model for Cybersecurity Intelligence,"Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.",2025-10-10 19:38:53+00:00,2025-09-30 20:12:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00240v2
Secure and Robust Watermarking for AI-generated Images: A Comprehensive Survey,"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has facilitated the effortless creation of high-quality images, while simultaneously raising critical concerns regarding intellectual property protection, authenticity, and accountability. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by distinguishing AI-generated images from natural content, ensuring provenance, and fostering trustworthy digital ecosystems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of AI-generated image watermarking, addressing five key dimensions: (1) formalization of image watermarking systems; (2) an overview and comparison of diverse watermarking techniques; (3) evaluation methodologies with respect to visual quality, capacity, and detectability; (4) vulnerabilities to malicious attacks; and (5) prevailing challenges and future directions. The survey aims to equip researchers with a holistic understanding of AI-generated image watermarking technologies, thereby promoting their continued development.",2025-09-30 18:59:05+00:00,2025-09-30 18:59:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02384v1
Drones that Think on their Feet: Sudden Landing Decisions with Embodied AI,"Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms, faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.",2025-09-30 18:39:36+00:00,2025-09-30 18:39:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00167v1
Calyx: Privacy-Preserving Multi-Token Optimistic-Rollup Protocol,"Rollup protocols have recently received significant attention as a promising class of Layer 2 (L2) scalability solutions. By utilizing the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain solely as a bulletin board for a summary of the executed transactions and state changes, rollups enable secure off-chain execution while avoiding the complexity of other L2 mechanisms. However, to ensure data availability, current rollup protocols require the plaintext of executed transactions to be published on-chain, resulting in inherent privacy limitations.   In this paper, we address this problem by introducing Calyx, the first privacy-preserving multi-token optimistic-Rollup protocol. Calyx guarantees full payment privacy for all L2 transactions, revealing no information about the sender, recipient, transferred amount, or token type. The protocol further supports atomic execution of multiple multi-token transactions and introduces a transaction fee scheme to enable broader application scenarios while ensuring the sustainable operation of the protocol. To enforce correctness, Calyx adopts an efficient one-step fraud-proof mechanism. We analyze the security and privacy guarantees of the protocol and provide an implementation and evaluation. Our results show that executing a single transaction costs approximately $0.06 (0.00002 ETH) and incurs only constant-size on-chain cost in asymptotic terms.",2025-09-30 18:35:31+00:00,2025-09-30 18:35:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00164v1
SPATA: Systematic Pattern Analysis for Detailed and Transparent Data Cards,"Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed. However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets, which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.",2025-09-30 17:59:45+00:00,2025-09-30 17:59:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26640v1
Are Robust LLM Fingerprints Adversarially Robust?,"Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness} against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future fingerprinting methods.",2025-09-30 17:47:09+00:00,2025-09-30 17:47:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26598v1
Selmer-Inspired Elliptic Curve Generation,"Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is foundational to modern secure communication, yet existing standard curves have faced scrutiny for opaque parameter-generation practices. This work introduces a Selmer-inspired framework for constructing elliptic curves that is both transparent and auditable. Drawing from $2$- and $3$-descent methods, we derive binary quartics and ternary cubics whose classical invariants deterministically yield candidate $(c_4,c_6)$ parameters. Local solubility checks, modeled on Selmer admissibility, filter candidates prior to reconciliation into short-Weierstrass form over prime fields. We then apply established cryptographic validations, including group-order factorization, cofactor bounds, twist security, and embedding-degree heuristics. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the pipeline functions as a retry-until-success Las Vegas algorithm, with complete transcripts enabling independent verification. Unlike seed-based or purely efficiency-driven designs, our approach embeds arithmetic structure into parameter selection while remaining compatible with constant-time, side-channel resistant implementations. This work broadens the design space for elliptic curves, showing that descent techniques from arithmetic geometry can underpin trust-enhancing, standardization-ready constructions.",2025-09-30 17:33:36+00:00,2025-09-30 17:33:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02383v1
DeepProv: Behavioral Characterization and Repair of Neural Networks via Inference Provenance Graph Analysis,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However, their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.   This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to capture and characterize the runtime behavior of DNNs during inference by using their underlying graph structure. Inspired by system audit provenance graphs, DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.   We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs, significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average 55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness. Beyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an adaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as privacy auditing and fairness analysis.",2025-09-30 17:29:02+00:00,2025-09-30 17:29:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26562v1
Explainable and Resilient ML-Based Physical-Layer Attack Detectors,"Detection of emerging attacks on network infrastructure is a critical aspect of security management. To meet the growing scale and complexity of modern threats, machine learning (ML) techniques offer valuable tools for automating the detection of malicious activities. However, as these techniques become more complex, their internal operations grow increasingly opaque. In this context, we address the need for explainable physical-layer attack detection methods. First, we analyze the inner workings of various classifiers trained to alert about physical layer intrusions, examining how the influence of different monitored parameters varies depending on the type of attack being detected. This analysis not only improves the interpretability of the models but also suggests ways to enhance their design for increased speed. In the second part, we evaluate the detectors' resilience to malicious parameter noising. The results highlight a key trade-off between model speed and resilience. This work serves as a design guideline for developing fast and robust detectors trained on available network monitoring data.",2025-09-30 17:05:33+00:00,2025-09-30 17:05:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26530v1
Logic Solver Guided Directed Fuzzing for Hardware Designs,"The ever-increasing complexity of design specifications for processors and intellectual property (IP) presents a formidable challenge for early bug detection in the modern IC design cycle. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing have proven effective in detecting bugs in RTL designs of cutting-edge processors. The modern IC design flow involves incremental updates and modifications to the hardware designs necessitating rigorous verification and extending the overall verification period. To accelerate this process, directed fuzzing has emerged focusing on generating targeted stimuli for specific regions of the design, avoiding the need for exhaustive, full-scale verification. However, a significant limitation of these hardware fuzzers lies in their reliance on an equivalent SW model of the hardware which fails to capture intrinsic hardware characteristics. To circumvent the aforementioned challenges, this work introduces TargetFuzz, an innovative and scalable targeted hardware fuzzing mechanism. It leverages SAT-based techniques to focus on specific regions of the hardware design while operating at its native hardware abstraction level, ensuring a more precise and comprehensive verification process. We evaluated this approach across a diverse range of RTL designs for various IP cores. Our experimental results demonstrate its capability to effectively target and fuzz a broad spectrum of sites within these designs, showcasing its extensive coverage and precision in addressing targeted regions. TargetFuzz demonstrates its capability to effectively scale 30x greater in terms of handling target sites, achieving 100% state coverage and 1.5x faster in terms of site coverage, and shows 90x improvement in target state coverage compared to Coverage-Guided Fuzzing, demonstrating its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in directed hardware fuzzing.",2025-09-30 16:50:50+00:00,2025-09-30 16:50:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26509v1
Exact Bias of Linear TRNG Correctors -- Spectral Approach,"Using Fourier analysis, this paper establishes exact security bounds for linear extractors in True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). We provide the first near-optimal total variation security characterization by interpolating between optimal $\ell_{\infty}$ and $\ell_2$ norm results, expressed through code weight enumerators and input bias parameters. Our bounds improve security assessments by an order of magnitude over previous approximations. By scanning ~20,000 codes, we reveal fundamental trade-offs between compression efficiency and cryptographic security. For instance, we show that achieving 80 bits of security can require sacrificing more than 50\% of the code rate when correcting 10\% input bias. Our bounds enhance security evaluation of TRNG post-processing schemes and quantify the inherent cost of randomness extraction in hardware implementations.",2025-09-30 15:27:43+00:00,2025-09-30 15:27:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26393v1
Strong random unitaries and fast scrambling,"Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.",2025-09-30 14:23:46+00:00,2025-09-30 14:23:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26310v1
"Private Learning of Littlestone Classes, Revisited","We consider online and PAC learning of Littlestone classes subject to the constraint of approximate differential privacy. Our main result is a private learner to online-learn a Littlestone class with a mistake bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{9.5}\cdot \log(T))$ in the realizable case, where $d$ denotes the Littlestone dimension and $T$ the time horizon. This is a doubly-exponential improvement over the state-of-the-art [GL'21] and comes polynomially close to the lower bound for this task.   The advancement is made possible by a couple of ingredients. The first is a clean and refined interpretation of the ``irreducibility'' technique from the state-of-the-art private PAC-learner for Littlestone classes [GGKM'21]. Our new perspective also allows us to improve the PAC-learner of [GGKM'21] and give a sample complexity upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{d^5 \log(1/δβ)}{\varepsilon α})$ where $α$ and $β$ denote the accuracy and confidence of the PAC learner, respectively. This improves over [GGKM'21] by factors of $\frac{d}α$ and attains an optimal dependence on $α$.   Our algorithm uses a private sparse selection algorithm to \emph{sample} from a pool of strongly input-dependent candidates. However, unlike most previous uses of sparse selection algorithms, where one only cares about the utility of output, our algorithm requires understanding and manipulating the actual distribution from which an output is drawn. In the proof, we use a sparse version of the Exponential Mechanism from [GKM'21] which behaves nicely under our framework and is amenable to a very easy utility proof.",2025-09-30 01:22:40+00:00,2025-09-30 01:22:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00076v1
Zero Trust-based Decentralized Identity Management System for Autonomous Vehicles,"The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises to significantly enhance transportation safety and efficiency by mitigating human error, which is responsible for over 90\% of road accidents. However, the increasing connectivity of AVs introduces new cybersecurity challenges, as traditional perimeter-based security models are inadequate for dynamic and untrusted environments. This paper presents a novel Zero Trust-based Decentralized Identity Management (D-IM) protocol for AVs. By integrating the core principles of Zero Trust Architecture, ""never trust, always verify"", with the tamper resistant and decentralized nature of a blockchain network, our framework eliminates reliance on centralized authorities and provides continuous verification for every entity. We detail the system's design, which leverages Hyperledger Iroha to enable lightweight and secure authentication without a central trusted entity. A comprehensive experimental evaluation, conducted across both urban and highway scenarios, validates the protocol's practicality. Our results demonstrate that the D-IM framework introduces minimal overhead, with less than 7.5\% reduction in Packet Reception Rate (PRR) in urban settings and an increase of under 11\% in Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) for LTE-V2X. These findings prove the protocol's efficiency and robustness, providing a resilient foundation for securing real-time V2X communication against impersonation and replay attacks.",2025-09-29 22:42:51+00:00,2025-09-29 22:42:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25566v1
Defeating Cerberus: Concept-Guided Privacy-Leakage Mitigation in Multimodal Language Models,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and reasoning over diverse modalities, but their advanced abilities also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. While relevant research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.",2025-09-29 21:27:10+00:00,2025-09-29 21:27:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25525v1
AGNOMIN -- Architecture Agnostic Multi-Label Function Name Prediction,"Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Renée-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements.   We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.",2025-10-01 05:13:21+00:00,2025-09-29 21:18:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25514v2
Environmental Rate Manipulation Attacks on Power Grid Security,"The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement a compact 14~$μ$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised 100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating fundamental challenges for hardware security.",2025-09-29 20:30:21+00:00,2025-09-29 20:30:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25476v1
Managing Differentiated Secure Connectivity using Intents,"Mobile networks in the 5G and 6G era require to rethink how to manage security due to the introduction of new services, use cases, each with its own security requirements, while simultaneously expanding the threat landscape. Although automation has emerged as a key enabler to address complexity in networks, existing approaches lack the expressiveness to define and enforce complex, goal-driven, and measurable security requirements. In this paper, we propose the concept of differentiated security levels and leveraging intents as a management framework. We discuss the requirements and enablers to extend the currently defined intent-based management frameworks to pave the path for intent-based security management in mobile networks. Our approach formalizes both functional and non-functional security requirements and demonstrates how these can be expressed and modeled using an extended TM Forum (TMF) intent security ontology. We further discuss the required standardization steps to achieve intent-based security management. Our work aims at advance security automation, improve adaptability, and strengthen the resilience and security posture of the next-generation mobile networks.",2025-09-29 20:08:23+00:00,2025-09-29 20:08:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25462v1
Fingerprinting LLMs via Prompt Injection,"Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.",2025-10-01 14:04:38+00:00,2025-09-29 19:54:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25448v2
Characterizing Event-themed Malicious Web Campaigns: A Case Study on War-themed Websites,"Cybercrimes such as online scams and fraud have become prevalent. Cybercriminals often abuse various global or regional events as themes of their fraudulent activities to breach user trust and attain a higher attack success rate. These attacks attempt to manipulate and deceive innocent people into interacting with meticulously crafted websites with malicious payloads, phishing, or fraudulent transactions. To deepen our understanding of the problem, this paper investigates how to characterize event-themed malicious website-based campaigns, with a case study on war-themed websites. We find that attackers tailor their attacks by exploiting the unique aspects of events, as evidenced by activities such as fundraising, providing aid, collecting essential supplies, or seeking updated news. We use explainable unsupervised clustering methods to draw further insights, which could guide the design of effective early defenses against various event-themed malicious web campaigns.",2025-09-29 19:07:15+00:00,2025-09-29 19:07:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25410v1
Optimal Threshold Signatures in Bitcoin,"We formulate the design of a threshold signature scheme as made possible on cryptocurrency protocols like Bitcoin. The funds are secured by an m-of-n threshold signature, where at least m signatures are needed to unlock the funds. A user designs this scheme knowing that a malicious attacker can also obtain the signatures with some probability. Higher thresholds offer more security, but also risk locking the user out of his own funds. The optimal threshold balances these twin effects. Interventions like increasing the security or usability of the signatures allow for higher thresholds. We model dynamic threshold signature schemes, where the probability of a user or attacker obtaining signatures decays with time. A dynamic threshold signature scheme is optimal, and increasing security or usability allows for higher thresholds and longer time locks.",2025-09-29 19:04:19+00:00,2025-09-29 19:04:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25408v1
Optimizing Privacy-Preserving Primitives to Support LLM-Scale Applications,"Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper, we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts, including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer inference.",2025-09-29 17:16:51+00:00,2025-09-29 17:16:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25072v1
SecInfer: Preventing Prompt Injection via Inference-time Scaling,"Prompt injection attacks pose a pervasive threat to the security of Large Language Models (LLMs). State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer}, a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling approaches.",2025-11-14 03:22:34+00:00,2025-09-29 16:00:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24967v4
Secret Leader Election in Ethereum PoS: An Empirical Security Analysis of Whisk and Homomorphic Sortition under DoS on the Leader and Censorship Attacks,"Proposer anonymity in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains is a critical concern due to the risk of targeted attacks such as malicious denial-of-service (DoS) and censorship attacks. While several Secret Single Leader Election (SSLE) mechanisms have been proposed to address these threats, their practical impact and trade-offs remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we present a unified experimental framework for evaluating SSLE mechanisms under adversarial conditions, grounded in a simplified yet representative model of Ethereum's PoS consensus layer. The framework includes configurable adversaries capable of launching targeted DoS and censorship attacks, including coordinated strategies that simultaneously compromise groups of validators. We simulate and compare key protection mechanisms - Whisk, and homomorphic sortition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study to examine adversarial DoS scenarios involving multiple attackers under diverse protection mechanisms. Our results show that while both designs offer strong protection against targeted DoS attacks on the leader, neither defends effectively against coordinated attacks on validator groups. Moreover, Whisk simplifies a DoS attack by narrowing the target set from all validators to a smaller list of known candidates. Homomorphic sortition, despite its theoretical strength, remains impractical due to the complexity of cryptographic operations over large validator sets.",2025-09-29 15:48:05+00:00,2025-09-29 15:48:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24955v1
Of-SemWat: High-payload text embedding for semantic watermarking of AI-generated images with arbitrary size,"We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding, where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing, and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.",2025-09-29 14:10:15+00:00,2025-09-29 14:10:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24823v1
Mapping Quantum Threats: An Engineering Inventory of Cryptographic Dependencies,"The emergence of large-scale quantum computers, powered by algorithms like Shor's and Grover's, poses an existential threat to modern public-key cryptography. This vulnerability stems from the ability of these machines to efficiently solve the hard mathematical problems - such as integer factorization and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem - that underpin widely used cryptographic primitives. This includes RSA, Diffie-Hellman (DH), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which are foundational to security across the digital ecosystem. Once Shor's algorithm becomes practically realizable, these primitives will fail, undermining both retrospective confidentiality and cryptographic authenticity - enabling adversaries to decrypt previously captured communications and forge digital signatures. This paper presents a systematic inventory of technologies exposed to quantum threats from the engineering perspective, organized by both technology domain and by implementation environment. While prior research has emphasized theoretical breaks or protocol-level adaptations, this work focuses on the practical landscape - mapping quantum-vulnerable systems across diverse digital infrastructures. The contribution is a cross-domain, cross-environment threat map to guide practitioners, vendors, and policymakers in identifying exposed technologies before the arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.",2025-09-29 11:30:17+00:00,2025-09-29 11:30:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24623v1
Sanitize Your Responses: Mitigating Privacy Leakage in Large Language Models,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards, adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses. Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering, which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues. This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

On the Limitations of Pseudorandom Unitaries,"Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), one of the key quantum pseudorandom notions, are efficiently computable unitaries that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar random unitaries. While there is evidence to believe that PRUs are weaker than one-way functions, so far its relationship with other quantum cryptographic primitives (that are plausibly weaker than one-way functions) has not been fully established.   In this work, we focus on quantum cryptographic primitives with classical communication, referred to as QCCC primitives. Our main result shows that QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement, cannot be constructed from pseudorandom unitaries in a black-box manner.   Our core technical contribution is to show (in a variety of settings) the difficulty of distinguishing identical versus independent Haar unitaries by separable channels. Our result strictly improves upon prior works which studied similar problems in the context of learning theory [Anshu, Landau, Liu, STOC 2022] and cryptography [Ananth, Gulati, Lin, TCC 2024].",2025-09-29 08:55:25+00:00,2025-09-29 08:55:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24484v1
BugMagnifier: TON Transaction Simulator for Revealing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities,"The Open Network (TON) blockchain employs an asynchronous execution model that introduces unique security challenges for smart contracts, particularly race conditions arising from unpredictable message processing order. While previous work established vulnerability patterns through static analysis of audit reports, dynamic detection of temporal dependencies through systematic testing remains an open problem. We present BugMagnifier, a transaction simulation framework that systematically reveals vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts through controlled message orchestration. Built atop TON Sandbox and integrated with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM), our tool combines precise message queue manipulation with differential state analysis and probabilistic permutation testing to detect asynchronous execution flaws. Experimental evaluation demonstrates BugMagnifier's effectiveness through extensive parametric studies on purpose-built vulnerable contracts, revealing message ratio-dependent detection complexity that aligns with theoretical predictions. This quantitative model enables predictive vulnerability assessment while shifting discovery from manual expert analysis to automated evidence generation. By providing reproducible test scenarios for temporal vulnerabilities, BugMagnifier addresses a critical gap in the TON security tooling, offering practical support for safer smart contract development in asynchronous blockchain environments.",2025-09-29 08:26:52+00:00,2025-09-29 08:26:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24444v1
Pseudorandom Unitaries in the Haar Random Oracle Model,"The quantum Haar random oracle model is an idealized model where every party has access to a single Haar random unitary and its inverse. We construct strong pseudorandom unitaries in the quantum Haar random oracle model. This strictly improves upon prior works who either only prove the existence of pseudorandom unitaries in the inverseless quantum Haar random oracle model [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin, EUROCRYPT 2025] or prove the existence of a weaker notion (implied by strong pseudorandom unitaries) in the quantum Haar random oracle model [Hhan, Yamada, 2024]. Our results also present a viable approach for building quantum pseudorandomness from random quantum circuits and analyzing pseudorandom objects in nature.",2025-09-29 08:17:29+00:00,2025-09-29 08:17:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24432v1
Watermarking Diffusion Language Models,"We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.",2025-09-29 07:11:40+00:00,2025-09-29 07:11:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368v1
"When MCP Servers Attack: Taxonomy, Feasibility, and Mitigation","Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable AI applications to connect to external systems in a plug-and-play manner, but their rapid proliferation also introduces severe security risks. Unlike mature software ecosystems with rigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving adversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this pressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP servers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to examine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically, we investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious MCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models (LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP server attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy comprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop Proof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across diverse real-world host-LLM settings. We further show that attackers can generate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost. We then test state-of-the-art scanners on the generated servers and found that existing detection approaches are insufficient. These findings highlight that malicious MCP servers are easy to implement, difficult to detect with current tools, and capable of causing concrete damage to AI agent systems. Addressing this threat requires coordinated efforts among protocol designers, host developers, LLM providers, and end users to build a more secure and resilient MCP ecosystem.",2025-09-29 04:29:58+00:00,2025-09-29 04:29:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24272v1
VeriLLM: A Lightweight Framework for Publicly Verifiable Decentralized Inference,"Decentralized inference provides a scalable and resilient paradigm for serving large language models (LLMs), enabling distributed resource utilization and reducing reliance on centralized providers. However, in a permissionless environment without trusted nodes, ensuring the correctness of model outputs remains a core challenge. We introduce VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference that achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption while maintaining practical efficiency. VeriLLM combines lightweight empirical rerunning with cryptographic commitments, allowing verifiers to validate results at approximately 1% of the underlying inference cost. To prevent verification bottlenecks, we design an isomorphic inference-verification architecture that multiplexes both inference and verification roles across the same GPU workers. This design (i) improves GPU utilization and overall throughput, (ii) enlarges the effective validator set, enhancing robustness and liveness, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability to prevent node-specific optimizations or selective behavior. Through theoretical analysis and system-level evaluation, we show that VeriLLM achieves reliable public verifiability with minimal overhead, offering a practical foundation for trustworthy and scalable decentralized LLM inference.",2025-11-10 16:52:26+00:00,2025-09-29 04:07:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24257v3
Takedown: How It's Done in Modern Coding Agent Exploits,"Coding agents, which are LLM-driven agents specialized in software development, have become increasingly prevalent in modern programming environments. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, which offer simple code completion and suggestions, modern coding agents tackle more complex tasks with greater autonomy, such as generating entire programs from natural language instructions. To enable such capabilities, modern coding agents incorporate extensive functionalities, which in turn raise significant concerns over their security and privacy. Despite their growing adoption, systematic and in-depth security analysis of these agents has largely been overlooked.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of eight real-world coding agents. Our analysis addresses the limitations of prior approaches, which were often fragmented and ad hoc, by systematically examining the internal workflows of coding agents and identifying security threats across their components. Through the analysis, we identify 15 security issues, including previously overlooked or missed issues, that can be abused to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of user systems. Furthermore, we show that these security issues are not merely individual vulnerabilities, but can collectively lead to end-to-end exploitations. By leveraging these security issues, we successfully achieved arbitrary command execution in five agents and global data exfiltration in four agents, all without any user interaction or approval. Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive security analysis in modern LLM-driven agents and demonstrate how insufficient security considerations can lead to severe vulnerabilities.",2025-09-29 03:27:18+00:00,2025-09-29 03:27:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24240v1
Hound: Relation-First Knowledge Graphs for Complex-System Reasoning in Security Audits,"Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g., monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to support reproduction.",2025-09-29 02:46:02+00:00,2025-09-29 02:46:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09633v1
Fundamental Limit of Discrete Distribution Estimation under Utility-Optimized Local Differential Privacy,"We study the problem of discrete distribution estimation under utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP), which enforces local differential privacy (LDP) on sensitive data while allowing more accurate inference on non-sensitive data. In this setting, we completely characterize the fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. The converse proof builds on several key ideas, including a generalized uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound, a reduction showing that it suffices to consider a newly defined class of extremal ULDP mechanisms, and a novel distribution decomposition technique tailored to ULDP constraints. For the achievability, we propose a class of utility-optimized block design (uBD) schemes, obtained as nontrivial modifications of the block design mechanism known to be optimal under standard LDP constraints, while incorporating the distribution decomposition idea used in the converse proof and a score-based linear estimator. These results provide a tight characterization of the estimation accuracy achievable under ULDP and reveal new insights into the structure of optimal mechanisms for privacy-preserving statistical inference.",2025-09-29 01:41:36+00:00,2025-09-29 01:41:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24173v1
WAREX: Web Agent Reliability Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks,"Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping. Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically. However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side, server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates, highlighting the limited robustness of state-of-the-art agents.",2025-09-28 20:51:05+00:00,2025-09-28 20:51:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03285v1
Automated Vulnerability Validation and Verification: A Large Language Model Approach,"Software vulnerabilities remain a critical security challenge, providing entry points for attackers into enterprise networks. Despite advances in security practices, the lack of high-quality datasets capturing diverse exploit behavior limits effective vulnerability assessment and mitigation. This paper introduces an end-to-end multi-step pipeline leveraging generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to address the challenges of orchestrating and reproducing attacks to known software vulnerabilities. Our approach extracts information from CVE disclosures in the National Vulnerability Database, augments it with external public knowledge (e.g., threat advisories, code snippets) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and automates the creation of containerized environments and exploit code for each vulnerability. The pipeline iteratively refines generated artifacts, validates attack success with test cases, and supports complex multi-container setups. Our methodology overcomes key obstacles, including noisy and incomplete vulnerability descriptions, by integrating LLMs and RAG to fill information gaps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline across different vulnerability types, such as memory overflows, denial of service, and remote code execution, spanning diverse programming languages, libraries and years. In doing so, we uncover significant inconsistencies in CVE descriptions, emphasizing the need for more rigorous verification in the CVE disclosure process. Our approach is model-agnostic, working across multiple LLMs, and we open-source the artifacts to enable reproducibility and accelerate security research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to systematically orchestrate and exploit known vulnerabilities in containerized environments by combining general-purpose LLM reasoning with CVE data and RAG-based context enrichment.",2025-11-13 23:47:08+00:00,2025-09-28 19:16:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24037v2
Binary Diff Summarization using Large Language Models,"Security of software supply chains is necessary to ensure that software updates do not contain maliciously injected code or introduce vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of critical infrastructure. Verifying the integrity of software updates involves binary differential analysis (binary diffing) to highlight the changes between two binary versions by incorporating binary analysis and reverse engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to binary analysis to augment traditional tools by producing natural language summaries that cybersecurity experts can grasp for further analysis. Combining LLM-based binary code summarization with binary diffing can improve the LLM's focus on critical changes and enable complex tasks such as automated malware detection. To address this, we propose a novel framework for binary diff summarization using LLMs. We introduce a novel functional sensitivity score (FSS) that helps with automated triage of sensitive binary functions for downstream detection tasks. We create a software supply chain security benchmark by injecting 3 different malware into 6 open-source projects which generates 104 binary versions, 392 binary diffs, and 46,023 functions. On this, our framework achieves a precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.64 for malware detection, displaying high accuracy with low false positives. Across malicious and benign functions, we achieve FSS separation of 3.0 points, confirming that FSS categorization can classify sensitive functions. We conduct a case study on the real-world XZ utils supply chain attack; our framework correctly detects the injected backdoor functions with high FSS.",2025-09-28 16:47:24+00:00,2025-09-28 16:47:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23970v1
Dynamic Orthogonal Continual Fine-tuning for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgettings,"Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/meloxxxxxx/DOC.",2025-09-28 13:55:05+00:00,2025-09-28 13:55:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23893v1
"Quant Fever, Reasoning Blackholes, Schrodinger's Compliance, and More: Probing GPT-OSS-20B","OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior under different adversarial conditions. Using the Jailbreak Oracle (JO) [1], a systematic LLM evaluation tool, the study uncovers several failure modes including quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrodinger's compliance, reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting. Experiments demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on the GPT-OSS-20B model, leading to severe consequences.",2025-10-05 14:53:45+00:00,2025-09-28 13:44:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23882v2
GPM: The Gaussian Pancake Mechanism for Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Differential Privacy,"Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for preserving individual privacy in data analysis. However, an implicit yet fundamental assumption underlying these rigorous privacy guarantees is the correct implementation and execution of DP mechanisms. Several incidents of unintended privacy loss have occurred due to numerical issues and inappropriate configurations of DP software, which have been successfully exploited in privacy attacks. To better understand the seriousness of defective DP software, we ask the following question: is it possible to elevate these passive defects into active privacy attacks while maintaining covertness?   To address this question, we present the Gaussian pancake mechanism (GPM), a novel mechanism that is computationally indistinguishable from the widely used Gaussian mechanism (GM), yet exhibits arbitrarily weaker statistical DP guarantees. This unprecedented separation enables a new class of backdoor attacks: by indistinguishably passing off as the authentic GM, GPM can covertly degrade statistical privacy. Unlike the unintentional privacy loss caused by GM's numerical issues, GPM is an adversarial yet undetectable backdoor attack against data privacy. We formally prove GPM's covertness, characterize its statistical leakage, and demonstrate a concrete distinguishing attack that can achieve near-perfect success rates under suitable parameter choices, both theoretically and empirically.   Our results underscore the importance of using transparent, open-source DP libraries and highlight the need for rigorous scrutiny and formal verification of DP implementations to prevent subtle, undetectable privacy compromises in real-world systems.",2025-09-28 12:14:06+00:00,2025-09-28 12:14:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23834v1
SafeSearch: Automated Red-Teaming for the Safety of LLM-Based Search Agents,"Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.",2025-10-15 02:32:00+00:00,2025-09-28 07:05:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23694v3
AutoML in Cybersecurity: An Empirical Study,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a promising paradigm for automating machine learning (ML) pipeline design, broadening AI adoption. Yet its reliability in complex domains such as cybersecurity remains underexplored. This paper systematically evaluates eight open-source AutoML frameworks across 11 publicly available cybersecurity datasets, spanning intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing, fraud detection, and spam filtering. Results show substantial performance variability across tools and datasets, with no single solution consistently superior. A paradigm shift is observed: the challenge has moved from selecting individual ML models to identifying the most suitable AutoML framework, complicated by differences in runtime efficiency, automation capabilities, and supported features. AutoML tools frequently favor tree-based models, which perform well but risk overfitting and limit interpretability. Key challenges identified include adversarial vulnerability, model drift, and inadequate feature engineering. We conclude with best practices and research directions to strengthen robustness, interpretability, and trust in AutoML for high-stakes cybersecurity applications.",2025-09-28 03:52:46+00:00,2025-09-28 03:52:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23621v1
Uncovering Vulnerabilities of LLM-Assisted Cyber Threat Intelligence,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.",2025-10-01 15:57:32+00:00,2025-09-28 02:08:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23573v2
Benchmarking LLM-Assisted Blue Teaming via Standardized Threat Hunting,"As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.",2025-10-01 16:01:24+00:00,2025-09-28 02:08:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23571v2
Formalization Driven LLM Prompt Jailbreaking via Reinforcement Learning,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework (\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and \underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions, which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses. The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.",2025-09-28 01:38:00+00:00,2025-09-28 01:38:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23558v1
Measuring Physical-World Privacy Awareness of Large Language Models: An Evaluation Benchmark,"The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\% accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore, when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion over the constraint in up to 86\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\% of the time. These findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more robust, physically-aware alignment. Codes and datasets will be available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/EAPrivacy.",2025-10-13 17:24:22+00:00,2025-09-27 23:39:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02356v2
ReliabilityRAG: Effective and Provably Robust Defense for RAG-based Web-Search,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO.   Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents.   Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a ""consistent majority"" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents.   We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.",2025-09-27 22:36:42+00:00,2025-09-27 22:36:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23519v1
MaskSQL: Safeguarding Privacy for LLM-Based Text-to-SQL via Abstraction,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging. However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical. Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations. Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts. Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.",2025-09-30 17:43:21+00:00,2025-09-27 19:07:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23459v2
StarveSpam: Mitigating Spam with Local Reputation in Permissionless Blockchains,"Spam poses a growing threat to blockchain networks. Adversaries can easily create multiple accounts to flood transaction pools, inflating fees and degrading service quality. Existing defenses against spam, such as fee markets and staking requirements, primarily rely on economic deterrence, which fails to distinguish between malicious and legitimate users and often exclude low-value but honest activity. To address these shortcomings, we present StarveSpam, a decentralized reputation-based protocol that mitigates spam by operating at the transaction relay layer. StarveSpam combines local behavior tracking, peer scoring, and adaptive rate-limiting to suppress abusive actors, without requiring global consensus, protocol changes, or trusted infrastructure. We evaluate StarveSpam using real Ethereum data from a major NFT spam event and show that it outperforms existing fee-based and rule-based defenses, allowing each node to block over 95% of spam while dropping just 3% of honest traffic, and reducing the fraction of the network exposed to spam by 85% compared to existing rule-based methods. StarveSpam offers a scalable and deployable alternative to traditional spam defenses, paving the way toward more resilient and equitable blockchain infrastructure.",2025-09-27 17:42:21+00:00,2025-09-27 17:42:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23427v1
"Noisy Networks, Nosy Neighbors: Inferring Privacy Invasive Information from Encrypted Wireless Traffic","This thesis explores the extent to which passive observation of wireless traffic in a smart home environment can be used to infer privacy-invasive information about its inhabitants. Using a setup that mimics the capabilities of a nosy neighbor in an adjacent flat, we analyze raw 802.11 packets and Bluetooth Low Energy advertisemets. From this data, we identify devices, infer their activity states and approximate their location using RSSI-based trilateration. Despite the encrypted nature of the data, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect active periods of multimedia devices, infer common activities such as sleeping, working and consuming media, and even approximate the layout of the neighbor's apartment. Our results show that privacy risks in smart homes extend beyond traditional data breaches: a nosy neighbor behind the wall can gain privacy-invasive insights into the lives of their neighbors purely from encrypted network traffic.",2025-09-27 15:36:11+00:00,2025-09-27 15:36:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13822v1
ICS-SimLab: A Containerized Approach for Simulating Industrial Control Systems for Cyber Security Research,"Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are complex interconnected systems used to manage process control within industrial environments, such as chemical processing plants and water treatment facilities. As the modern industrial environment moves towards Internet-facing services, ICSs face an increased risk of attacks that necessitates ICS-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The development of such IDS relies significantly on a simulated testbed as it is unrealistic and sometimes hazardous to utilize an operational control system. Whilst some testbeds have been proposed, they often use a limited selection of virtual ICS simulations to test and verify cyber security solutions. There is a lack of investigation done on developing systems that can efficiently simulate multiple ICS architectures. Currently, the trend within research involves developing security solutions on just one ICS simulation, which can result in bias to its specific architecture. We present ICS-SimLab, an end-to-end software suite that utilizes Docker containerization technology to create a highly configurable ICS simulation environment. This software framework enables researchers to rapidly build and customize different ICS environments, facilitating the development of security solutions across different systems that adhere to the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture. To demonstrate its capability, we present three virtual ICS simulations: a solar panel smart grid, a water bottle filling facility, and a system of intelligent electronic devices. Furthermore, we run cyber-attacks on these simulations and construct a dataset of recorded malicious and benign network traffic to be used for IDS development.",2025-09-27 13:39:54+00:00,2025-09-27 13:39:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23305v1
An Investigation into the Performance of Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Network Intrusion Detection,"Network intrusion detection, a well-explored cybersecurity field, has predominantly relied on supervised learning algorithms in the past two decades. However, their limitations in detecting only known anomalies prompt the exploration of alternative approaches. Motivated by the success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, there is a rising interest in adapting this paradigm for network intrusion detection. While prior research mainly delved into contrastive self-supervised methods, the efficacy of non-contrastive methods, in conjunction with encoder architectures serving as the representation learning backbone and augmentation strategies that determine what is learned, remains unclear for effective attack detection. This paper compares the performance of five non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods using three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies. Ninety experiments are systematically conducted on two network intrusion detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD. For each self-supervised model, the combination of encoder architecture and augmentation method yielding the highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC is reported. Furthermore, by comparing the best-performing models to two unsupervised baselines, DeepSVDD, and an Autoencoder, we showcase the competitiveness of the non-contrastive methods for attack detection.

A Near-Cache Architectural Framework for Cryptographic Computing,"Recent advancements in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have led to their standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to safeguard information security in the post-quantum era. These algorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\times$ longer than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant performance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified in our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption of on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers high-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals challenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems and performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting the need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing systems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we introduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization and virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications. By placing SRAM arrays with bitline computing capability near cache slices, high internal bandwidth and short data movement are achieved with native support of virtual addressing. An ISA extension to facilitate CNC is also proposed, with detailed discussion on the implementation aspects of the core/cache datapath.",2025-09-27 08:15:17+00:00,2025-09-27 08:15:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23179v1
Towards Quantum-Ready Blockchain Fraud Detection via Ensemble Graph Neural Networks,"Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.",2025-09-27 04:17:23+00:00,2025-09-27 04:17:23+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23101v1
FedBit: Accelerating Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Bit-Interleaved Packing and Cross-Layer Co-Design,"Federated learning (FL) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) effectively safeguards data privacy during model aggregation by encrypting local model updates before transmission, mitigating threats from untrusted servers or eavesdroppers in transmission. However, the computational burden and ciphertext expansion associated with homomorphic encryption can significantly increase resource and communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedBit, a hardware/software co-designed framework optimized for the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme. FedBit employs bit-interleaved data packing to embed multiple model parameters into a single ciphertext coefficient, thereby minimizing ciphertext expansion and maximizing computational parallelism. Additionally, we integrate a dedicated FPGA accelerator to handle cryptographic operations and an optimized dataflow to reduce the memory overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that FedBit achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude in encryption and lowers average communication overhead by 60.7%, while maintaining high accuracy.",2025-09-27 03:58:16+00:00,2025-09-27 03:58:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23091v1
"Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread ""VIA"" Synthetic Data","Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective ""shell"" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.",2025-10-24 07:58:07+00:00,2025-09-27 01:39:41+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23041v2
CryptoSRAM: Enabling High-Throughput Cryptography on MCUs via In-SRAM Computing,"Secure communication is a critical requirement for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are often based on Microcontroller Units (MCUs). Current cryptographic solutions, which rely on software libraries or dedicated hardware accelerators, are fundamentally limited by the performance and energy costs of data movement between memory and processing units. This paper introduces CryptoSRAM, an in-SRAM computing architecture that performs cryptographic operations directly within the MCU's standard SRAM array. By repurposing the memory array into a massively parallel processing fabric, CryptoSRAM eliminates the data movement bottleneck. This approach is well-suited to MCUs, which utilize physical addressing and Direct Memory Access (DMA) to manage SRAM, allowing for seamless integration with minimal hardware overhead. Our analysis shows that for common cryptographic kernels, CryptoSRAM achieves throughput improvements of up to 74$\times$ and 67$\times$ for AES and SHA3, respectively, compared to a software implementation. Furthermore, our solution delivers up to 6$\times$ higher throughput than existing hardware accelerators for AES.

"Blockchain-Based Secure Online Voting Platform Ensuring Voter Anonymity, Integrity, and End-to-End Verifiability","Casting a ballot from a phone or laptop sounds appealing, but only if voters can be confident their choice remains secret and results cannot be altered in the dark. This paper proposes a hybrid blockchain-based voting model that stores encrypted votes on a private blockchain maintained by election organizers and neutral observers, while periodically anchoring hashes of these votes onto a public blockchain as a tamper-evident seal. The system issues voters one-time blind-signed tokens to protect anonymity, and provides receipts so they can confirm their vote was counted. We implemented a live prototype using common web technologies (Next.js, React, Firebase) to demonstrate end-to-end functionality, accessibility, and cost efficiency. Our contributions include developing a working demo, a complete election workflow, a hybrid blockchain design, and a user-friendly interface that balances privacy, security, transparency, and practicality.

PAPER: Privacy-Preserving ResNet Models using Low-Degree Polynomial Approximations and Structural Optimizations on Leveled FHE,"Recent work has made non-interactive privacy-preserving inference more practical by running deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). However, these methods remain limited by their reliance on bootstrapping, a costly FHE operation applied across multiple layers, severely slowing inference. They also depend on high-degree polynomial approximations of non-linear activations, which increase multiplicative depth and reduce accuracy by 2-5% compared to plaintext ReLU models. In this work, we focus on ResNets, a widely adopted benchmark architecture in privacy-preserving inference, and close the accuracy gap between their FHE-based non-interactive models and plaintext counterparts, while also achieving faster inference than existing methods. We use a quadratic polynomial approximation of ReLU, which achieves the theoretical minimum multiplicative depth for non-linear activations, along with a penalty-based training strategy. We further introduce structural optimizations such as node fusing, weight redistribution, and tower reuse. These optimizations reduce the required FHE levels in CNNs by nearly a factor of five compared to prior work, allowing us to run ResNet models under leveled FHE without bootstrapping. To further accelerate inference and recover accuracy typically lost with polynomial approximations, we introduce parameter clustering along with a joint strategy of data encoding layout and ensemble techniques. Experiments with ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our approach achieves up to 4x faster private inference than prior work with comparable accuracy to plaintext ReLU models.",2025-09-26 19:10:23+00:00,2025-09-26 19:10:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22857v1
What Do They Fix? LLM-Aided Categorization of Security Patches for Critical Memory Bugs,"Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems, with the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity and complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the Linux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption, creating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty in identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing exploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and use-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally silent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE issuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux kernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit limitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously unexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch classification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages and diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method pipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM) and a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM successfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing OOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual verification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions). Moreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and one OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow hijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification.",2025-09-26 18:06:36+00:00,2025-09-26 18:06:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22796v1
Voting-Bloc Entropy: A New Metric for DAO Decentralization,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of decentralization, however -- the 'D' in DAO -- fall short of capturing the key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. This work proposes a new framework for measuring DAO decentralization called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe''). VBE is based on the idea that voters with closely aligned interests act as a centralizing force and should be modeled as such. VBE formalizes this notion by measuring the similarity of participants' utility functions across a set of voting rounds. Unlike prior, ad hoc definitions of decentralization, VBE derives from first principles: We introduce a simple (yet powerful) reinforcement learning-based conceptual model for voting, that in turn implies VBE. We first show VBE's utility as a theoretical tool. We prove a number of results about the (de)centralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, etc. that are overlooked in previous notions of DAO decentralization. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. We also show how VBE can be used empirically by presenting measurement studies and VBE-based governance experiments. We make the tools we developed for these results available to the community in the form of open-source artifacts in order to facilitate future study of DAO decentralization.",2025-09-26 17:46:07+00:00,2025-09-26 17:46:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22620v1
Bridging Technical Capability and User Accessibility: Off-grid Civilian Emergency Communication,"During large-scale crises disrupting cellular and Internet infrastructure, civilians lack reliable methods for communication, aid coordination, and access to trustworthy information. This paper presents a unified emergency communication system integrating a low-power, long-range network with a crisis-oriented smartphone application, enabling decentralized and off-grid civilian communication. Unlike previous solutions separating physical layer resilience from user layer usability, our design merges these aspects into a cohesive crisis-tailored framework.   The system is evaluated in two dimensions: communication performance and application functionality. Field experiments in urban Zürich demonstrate that the 868 MHz band, using the LongFast configuration, achieves a communication range of up to 1.2 km with 92% Packet Delivery Ratio, validating network robustness under real-world infrastructure degraded conditions. In parallel, a purpose-built mobile application featuring peer-to-peer messaging, identity verification, and community moderation was evaluated through a requirements-based analysis.",2025-09-29 16:36:21+00:00,2025-09-26 16:44:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22568v2
"Smart Medical IoT Security Vulnerabilities: Real-Time MITM Attack Analysis, Lightweight Encryption Implementation, and Practitioner Perceptions in Underdeveloped Nigerian Healthcare Systems","The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in Nigerian healthcare offers potential improvements in remote monitoring and data-driven care, but unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices exposes patient data to cyber threats. This study investigates such vulnerabilities through a real-time Man in the Middle (MITM) attack simulation and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption on low-cost devices.   A prototype mIoT device was built with a NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors for heart rate and temperature. In controlled lab conditions simulating local healthcare networks, unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted and altered using common tools (Bettercap, Wireshark). After AES-128 encryption was applied, all transmissions became unreadable and tamper attempts failed, demonstrating its effectiveness.   Performance costs were modest, latency rose from 80 ms to 125 ms (56.25 percent increase) and CPU use from 30 percent to 45 percent, but system stability remained intact. Device cost stayed under 18,000 NGN (about 12 USD), making it feasible for Nigeria's resource constrained facilities.   A survey of healthcare professionals showed moderate awareness of IoT-related risks but strong support for encryption and staff training. Barriers included limited budgets and technical complexity.   The study concludes that lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical, low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational efficiency. Feedback from professionals highlights the urgency of improving security awareness and establishing guidelines for clinical deployment.",2025-09-26 15:45:16+00:00,2025-09-26 15:45:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09629v1
Privacy Mechanism Design based on Empirical Distributions,"Pointwise maximal leakage (PML) is a per-outcome privacy measure based on threat models from quantitative information flow. Privacy guarantees with PML rely on knowledge about the distribution that generated the private data. In this work, we propose a framework for PML privacy assessment and mechanism design with empirical estimates of this data-generating distribution. By extending the PML framework to consider sets of data-generating distributions, we arrive at bounds on the worst-case leakage within a given set. We use these bounds alongside large-deviation bounds from the literature to provide a method for obtaining distribution-independent $(\varepsilon,δ)$-PML guarantees when the data-generating distribution is estimated from available data samples. We provide an optimal binary mechanism, and show that mechanism design with this type of uncertainty about the data-generating distribution reduces to a linearly constrained convex program. Further, we show that optimal mechanisms designed for a distribution estimate can be used. Finally, we apply these tools to leakage assessment of the Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism for binary private data, and numerically show that the presented approach to mechanism design can yield significant utility increase compared to local differential privacy, while retaining similar privacy guarantees.",2025-09-26 14:46:59+00:00,2025-09-26 14:46:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22428v1
New Quantum Internet Applications via Verifiable One-Time Programs,"We introduce Verifiable One-Time Programs (Ver-OTPs) and use them to construct single-round Open Secure Computation (OSC), a novel primitive enabling applications like (1) single-round sealed-bid auctions, (2) single-round and honest-majority atomic proposes -- a building block of consensus protocols, and (3) single-round differentially private statistical aggregation without pre-registration. First, we construct Ver-OTPs from single-qubit states and classical cryptographic primitives. Then, assuming a multi-key homomorphic scheme (MHE) with certain properties, we use Ver-OTPs with MHE to construct OSC. The underlying quantum requirement is minimal: only single-qubit states are needed alongside a hardware assumption on the receiver's quantum resources. Our work therefore provides a new framework for quantum-assisted cryptography that may be implementable with near-term quantum technology.",2025-09-26 12:53:16+00:00,2025-09-26 12:53:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22290v1
Accuracy-First Rényi Differential Privacy and Post-Processing Immunity,"The accuracy-first perspective of differential privacy addresses an important shortcoming by allowing a data analyst to adaptively adjust the quantitative privacy bound instead of sticking to a predetermined bound. Existing works on the accuracy-first perspective have neglected an important property of differential privacy known as post-processing immunity, which ensures that an adversary is not able to weaken the privacy guarantee by post-processing. We address this gap by determining which existing definitions in the accuracy-first perspective have post-processing immunity, and which do not. The only definition with post-processing immunity, pure ex-post privacy, lacks useful tools for practical problems, such as an ex-post analogue of the Gaussian mechanism, and an algorithm to check if accuracy on separate private validation set is high enough. To address this, we propose a new definition based on Rényi differential privacy that has post-processing immunity, and we develop basic theory and tools needed for practical applications. We demonstrate the practicality of our theory with an application to synthetic data generation, where our algorithm successfully adjusts the privacy bound until an accuracy threshold is met on a private validation dataset.",2025-09-26 11:27:36+00:00,2025-09-26 11:27:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22213v1
Red Teaming Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Standards: A Penetration Testing Framework Integrating AI and Quantum Security,"This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.",2025-09-26 10:36:59+00:00,2025-09-26 10:36:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22757v1
The Express Lane to Spam and Centralization: An Empirical Analysis of Arbitrum's Timeboost,"DeFi applications are vulnerable to MEV, where specialized actors profit by reordering or inserting transactions. To mitigate latency races and internalize MEV revenue, Arbitrum introduced Timeboost, an auction-based transaction sequencing mechanism that grants short-term priority access to an express lane. In this paper we present the first large-scale empirical study of Timeboost, analyzing over 11.5 million express lane transactions and 151 thousand auctions between April and July 2025. Our results reveal five main findings. First, express lane control is highly centralized, with two entities winning more than 90% of auctions. Second, while express lane access provides earlier inclusion, profitable MEV opportunities cluster at the end of blocks, limiting the value of priority access. Third, approximately 22% of time-boosted transactions are reverted, indicating that the Timeboost does not effectively mitigate spam. Fourth, secondary markets for reselling express lane rights have collapsed due to poor execution reliability and unsustainable economics. Finally, auction competition declined over time, leading to steadily reduced revenue for the Arbitrum DAO. Taken together, these findings show that Timeboost fails to deliver on its stated goals of fairness, decentralization, and spam reduction. Instead, it reinforces centralization and narrows adoption, highlighting the limitations of auction-based ordering as a mechanism for fair transaction sequencing in rollups.",2025-09-26 10:02:15+00:00,2025-09-26 10:02:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22143v1
Guidance Watermarking for Diffusion Models,"This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for diffusion models. It is based on guiding the diffusion process using the gradient computed from any off-the-shelf watermark decoder. The gradient computation encompasses different image augmentations, increasing robustness to attacks against which the decoder was not originally robust, without retraining or fine-tuning. Our method effectively convert any \textit{post-hoc} watermarking scheme into an in-generation embedding along the diffusion process. We show that this approach is complementary to watermarking techniques modifying the variational autoencoder at the end of the diffusion process. We validate the methods on different diffusion models and detectors. The watermarking guidance does not significantly alter the generated image for a given seed and prompt, preserving both the diversity and quality of generation.",2025-09-26 09:49:44+00:00,2025-09-26 09:49:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22126v1
SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios,"Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.",2025-09-26 09:18:57+00:00,2025-09-26 09:18:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1
Adversarial training with restricted data manipulation,"Adversarial machine learning concerns situations in which learners face attacks from active adversaries. Such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the everimproving generation of malicious data. Pessimistic Bilevel optimisation has been shown to be an effective method of training resilient classifiers against such adversaries. By modelling these scenarios as a game between the learner and the adversary, we anticipate how the adversary will modify their data and then train a resilient classifier accordingly. However, since existing pessimistic bilevel approaches feature an unrestricted adversary, the model is vulnerable to becoming overly pessimistic and unrealistic. When finding the optimal solution that defeats the classifier, it is possible that the adversary's data becomes nonsensical and loses its intended nature. Such an adversary will not properly reflect reality, and consequently, will lead to poor classifier performance when implemented on real-world data. By constructing a constrained pessimistic bilevel optimisation model, we restrict the adversary's movements and identify a solution that better reflects reality. We demonstrate through experiments that this model performs, on average, better than the existing approach.",2025-09-26 09:17:57+00:00,2025-09-26 09:17:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03254v1
Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment,"Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.",2025-10-09 13:00:18+00:00,2025-09-26 04:10:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745v2
The Dark Art of Financial Disguise in Web3: Money Laundering Schemes and Countermeasures,"The rise of Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has enabled borderless access to financial services empowered by smart contracts and blockchain technology. However, the ecosystem's trustless, permissionless, and borderless nature presents substantial regulatory challenges. The absence of centralized oversight and the technical complexity create fertile ground for financial crimes. Among these, money laundering is particularly concerning, as in the event of successful scams, code exploits, and market manipulations, it facilitates covert movement of illicit gains. Beyond this, there is a growing concern that cryptocurrencies can be leveraged to launder proceeds from drug trafficking, or to transfer funds linked to terrorism financing.   This survey aims to outline a taxonomy of high-level strategies and underlying mechanisms exploited to facilitate money laundering in Web3. We examine how criminals leverage the pseudonymous nature of Web3, alongside weak regulatory frameworks, to obscure illicit financial activities. Our study seeks to bridge existing knowledge gaps on laundering schemes, identify open challenges in the detection and prevention of such activities, and propose future research directions to foster a more transparent Web3 financial ecosystem -- offering valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners.",2025-09-26 03:47:58+00:00,2025-09-26 03:47:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21831v1
SoK: Potentials and Challenges of Large Language Models for Reverse Engineering,"Reverse Engineering (RE) is central to software security, enabling tasks such as vulnerability discovery and malware analysis, but it remains labor-intensive and requires substantial expertise. Earlier advances in deep learning start to automate parts of RE, particularly for malware detection and vulnerability classification. More recently, a rapidly growing body of work has applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to similar purposes. Their role compared to prior machine learning remains unclear, since some efforts simply adapt existing pipelines with minimal change while others seek to exploit broader reasoning and generative abilities. These differences, combined with varied problem definitions, methods, and evaluation practices, limit comparability, reproducibility, and cumulative progress. This paper systematizes the field by reviewing 44 research papers, including peer-reviewed publications and preprints, and 18 additional open-source projects that apply LLMs in RE. We propose a taxonomy that organizes existing work by objective, target, method, evaluation strategy, and data scale. Our analysis identifies strengths and limitations, highlights reproducibility and evaluation gaps, and examines emerging risks. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions that aim to guide more coherent and security-relevant applications of LLMs in RE.",2025-09-26 03:26:51+00:00,2025-09-26 03:26:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21821v1
PhishLumos: An Adaptive Multi-Agent System for Proactive Phishing Campaign Mitigation,"Phishing attacks are a significant societal threat, disproportionately harming vulnerable populations and eroding trust in essential digital services. Current defenses are often reactive, failing against modern evasive tactics like cloaking that conceal malicious content. To address this, we introduce PhishLumos, an adaptive multi-agent system that proactively mitigates entire attack campaigns. It confronts a core cybersecurity imbalance: attackers can easily scale operations, while defense remains an intensive expert task. Instead of being blocked by evasion, PhishLumos treats it as a critical signal to investigate the underlying infrastructure. Its Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents uncover shared hosting, certificates, and domain registration patterns. On real-world data, our system identified 100% of campaigns in the median case, over a week before their confirmation by cybersecurity experts. PhishLumos demonstrates a practical shift from reactive URL blocking to proactive campaign mitigation, protecting users before they are harmed and making the digital world safer for all.",2025-09-26 02:21:04+00:00,2025-09-26 02:21:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21772v1
MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs,"The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.   To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.",2025-10-03 17:43:57+00:00,2025-09-25 21:49:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21634v2
"Agentic-AI Healthcare: Multilingual, Privacy-First Framework with MCP Agents","This paper introduces Agentic-AI Healthcare, a privacy-aware, multilingual, and explainable research prototype developed as a single-investigator project. The system leverages the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) to orchestrate multiple intelligent agents for patient interaction, including symptom checking, medication suggestions, and appointment scheduling. The platform integrates a dedicated Privacy and Compliance Layer that applies role-based access control (RBAC), AES-GCM field-level encryption, and tamper-evident audit logging, aligning with major healthcare data protection standards such as HIPAA (US), PIPEDA (Canada), and PHIPA (Ontario).

Designing Ethereum's Geographical (De)Centralization Beyond the Atlantic,"Decentralization has a geographic dimension that conventional metrics such as stake distribution overlook. Where validators run affects resilience to regional shocks (outages, disasters, government intervention) and fairness in reward access. Yet in permissionless systems, locations cannot be mandated, but they emerge from incentives. Today, Ethereum's validators cluster along the Atlantic (EU and U.S. East Coast), where latency is structurally favorable. This raises a key question: when some regions already enjoy latency advantages, how does protocol design shape validator incentives and the geography of (de)centralization? We develop a latency-calibrated agent-based model and compare two Ethereum block-building paradigms: a Single-Source Paradigm (SSP), akin to MEV-Boost, where proposers fetch full blocks from a relay that also propagates them; and a Multi-Source Paradigm (MSP), where proposers aggregate value from multiple sources and broadcast the block themselves. Simulations show that SSP concentrates around relay placement but more slowly, since proximity mainly affects propagation, and the marginal value of time is relatively uniform across regions. MSP centralizes faster: aggregating across sources makes marginal value location-dependent, amplifying payoff dispersion and migration toward latency minima. Source placement and consensus settings can dampen or intensify these effects, though once validators are already clustered, the impact of source placement on decentralization is marginal. In most cases, North America consistently emerges as the focal hub. These findings show that protocol design materially shapes validator geography and offer levers for promoting geographical decentralization.",2025-09-25 19:40:49+00:00,2025-09-25 19:40:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21475v1
Adaptive Federated Learning Defences via Trust-Aware Deep Q-Networks,"Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best robustness--accuracy trade-off.",2025-09-25 13:30:09+00:00,2025-09-25 13:30:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01261v1
CTI Dataset Construction from Telegram,"Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect, and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.",2025-09-25 09:27:10+00:00,2025-09-25 09:27:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20943v1
Fast Revocable Attribute-Based Encryption with Data Integrity for Internet of Things,"Efficient and secure revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) is vital for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control and data sharing in cloud storage and outsourced data environments within the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current RABE schemes often struggle to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency, security, dynamic scalability, and other important features, which hampers their practical application. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fast RABE scheme with data integrity for IoT that achieves adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. Our scheme supports the revocation of authorized users and transfers the computationally heavy revocation processes to the cloud, thereby easing the computational burden on IoT devices. Moreover, it consistently guarantees the integrity and correctness of data. We have demonstrated its adaptive security within the defined security model with multiple challenge ciphertexts and optimized its performance. Experimental results indicate that our scheme provides better performance than existing solutions. Under the same access policy, our scheme reduces computational consumption by 7 to 9 times compared to previous schemes.",2025-09-25 06:24:29+00:00,2025-09-25 06:24:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20796v1
Cryptographic Backdoor for Neural Networks: Boon and Bane,"In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).",2025-09-25 03:27:46+00:00,2025-09-25 03:27:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20714v1
Average-Case Complexity of Quantum Stabilizer Decoding,"Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography.   More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or non-trivially equivalent complexity.",2025-09-25 03:04:40+00:00,2025-09-25 03:04:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20697v1
"Can Federated Learning Safeguard Private Data in LLM Training? Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defense Evaluation","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.",2025-09-25 02:28:08+00:00,2025-09-25 02:28:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20680v1
A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against Large Language Model Attacks,"The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability, multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.   Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.",2025-10-17 15:13:18+00:00,2025-09-25 00:36:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20639v2
Innovative Deep Learning Architecture for Enhanced Altered Fingerprint Recognition,"Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.",2025-09-24 20:12:37+00:00,2025-09-24 20:12:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20537v1
chainScale: Secure Functionality-oriented Scalability for Decentralized Resource Markets,"Decentralized resource markets are Web 3.0 applications that build open-access platforms for trading digital resources among users without any central management. They promise cost reduction, transparency, and flexible service provision. However, these markets usually have large workload that must be processed in a timely manner, leading to serious scalability problems. Despite the large amount of work on blockchain scalability, existing solutions are ineffective as they do not account for these markets' work models and traffic patterns.   We introduce chainScale, a secure hybrid sidechain-sharding solution that aims to boost throughput of decentralized resource markets and reduce their latency and storage footprint. At its core, chainScale leverages dependent sidechains and functionality-oriented workload splitting to parallelize traffic processing by having each market module assigned to a sidechain. Different from sharding, chainScale does not incur any cross-sidechain transactions that tend to be costly. chainScale introduces several techniques, including hierarchical workload sharing that further sub-divides overloaded modules, and weighted miner assignment that assigns miners with vested interest in the system to critical modules' sidechains. Furthermore, chainScale employs sidechain syncing to maintain the mainchain as the single truth of system state, and pruning to discard stale records. Beside analyzing security, we build a proof-of-concept implementation for a distributed file storage market as a use case. Our experiments show that, compared to a single sidechain-based prior solution, chainScale boosts throughput by 4x and reduces confirmation latency by 5x. Also, they show that chainScale outperforms sharding by 2.5x in throughput and 3.5x in latency.",2025-09-24 17:57:12+00:00,2025-09-24 17:57:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20356v1
Investigating Security Implications of Automatically Generated Code on the Software Supply Chain,"In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed significant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if developers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks into their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community. However, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code, including fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data, all of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this paper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these inherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven potential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code, and continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in LLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows, while some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the security of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and severity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on SSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four popular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified SSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce fabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC threats.",2025-09-24 16:15:17+00:00,2025-09-24 16:15:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20277v1
CyberSOCEval: Benchmarking LLMs Capabilities for Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning,"Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts, threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.",2025-11-10 19:42:29+00:00,2025-09-24 14:33:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20166v2
SafeSteer: Adaptive Subspace Steering for Efficient Jailbreak Defense in Vision-Language Models,"As the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) continue to improve, they are increasingly targeted by jailbreak attacks. Existing defense methods face two major limitations: (1) they struggle to ensure safety without compromising the model's utility; and (2) many defense mechanisms significantly reduce the model's inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose SafeSteer, a lightweight, inference-time steering framework that effectively defends against diverse jailbreak attacks without modifying model weights. At the core of SafeSteer is the innovative use of Singular Value Decomposition to construct a low-dimensional ""safety subspace."" By projecting and reconstructing the raw steering vector into this subspace during inference, SafeSteer adaptively removes harmful generation signals while preserving the model's ability to handle benign inputs. The entire process is executed in a single inference pass, introducing negligible overhead. Extensive experiments show that SafeSteer reduces the attack success rate by over 60% and improves accuracy on normal tasks by 1-2%, without introducing significant inference latency. These results demonstrate that robust and practical jailbreak defense can be achieved through simple, efficient inference-time control.",2025-09-24 12:46:41+00:00,2025-09-24 12:46:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21400v1
Generative Adversarial Networks Applied for Privacy Preservation in Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification,"Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes). Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.",2025-09-24 11:39:40+00:00,2025-09-24 11:39:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20024v1
OpenGL GPU-Based Rowhammer Attack (Work in Progress),"Rowhammer attacks have emerged as a significant threat to modern DRAM-based memory systems, leveraging frequent memory accesses to induce bit flips in adjacent memory cells. This work-in-progress paper presents an adaptive, many-sided Rowhammer attack utilizing GPU compute shaders to systematically achieve high-frequency memory access patterns. Our approach employs statistical distributions to optimize row targeting and avoid current mitigations. The methodology involves initializing memory with known patterns, iteratively hammering victim rows, monitoring for induced errors, and dynamically adjusting parameters to maximize success rates. The proposed attack exploits the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to accelerate hammering operations, thereby increasing the probability of successful bit flips within a constrained timeframe. By leveraging OpenGL compute shaders, our implementation achieves highly efficient row hammering with minimal software overhead. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrate that the GPU-based approach attains a high rate of bit flips compared to traditional CPU-based hammering, confirming its effectiveness in compromising DRAM integrity. Our findings align with existing research on microarchitectural attacks in heterogeneous systems that highlight the susceptibility of GPUs to security vulnerabilities. This study contributes to the understanding of GPU-assisted fault-injection attacks and underscores the need for improved mitigation strategies in future memory architectures.",2025-09-24 10:11:05+00:00,2025-09-24 10:11:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19959v1
A Set of Generalized Components to Achieve Effective Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks with Collaborative Sample Selection and Triggers,"Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject attacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without changing the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple \textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances clean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples instead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the sample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited improvements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit unsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a mere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional collaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address the above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple combination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance both evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks. Therefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both stealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically, Component A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an appropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable ``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples with similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote stealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors through distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR, with stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B. Furthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.",2025-10-07 09:40:48+00:00,2025-09-24 09:58:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19947v2
On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning,"This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.",2025-10-27 06:25:33+00:00,2025-09-24 09:22:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19921v2
Adversarial Defense in Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review of GANs for Threat Detection and Mitigation,"Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31, 2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185 peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain, and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet, persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability. GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered defenses.",2025-09-30 05:15:07+00:00,2025-09-24 07:17:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20411v2
Towards Adapting Federated & Quantum Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection: A Survey,"This survey explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), with particular emphasis on deep learning and quantum machine learning approaches. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy-a critical requirement in network security contexts where sensitive traffic data cannot be centralized. Our comprehensive analysis systematically examines the full spectrum of FL architectures, deployment strategies, communication protocols, and aggregation methods specifically tailored for intrusion detection. We provide an in-depth investigation of privacy-preserving techniques, model compression approaches, and attack-specific federated solutions for threats including DDoS, MITM, and botnet attacks. The survey further delivers a pioneering exploration of Quantum FL (QFL), discussing quantum feature encoding, quantum machine learning algorithms, and quantum-specific aggregation methods that promise exponential speedups for complex pattern recognition in network traffic. Through rigorous comparative analysis of classical and quantum approaches, identification of research gaps, and evaluation of real-world deployments, we outline a concrete roadmap for industrial adoption and future research directions. This work serves as an authoritative reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance privacy, efficiency, and robustness of federated intrusion detection systems in increasingly complex network environments, while preparing for the quantum-enhanced cybersecurity landscape of tomorrow.",2025-11-12 11:06:48+00:00,2025-09-24 01:39:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21389v2
SoK: A Systematic Review of Malware Ontologies and Taxonomies and Implications for the Quantum Era,"The threat of quantum malware is real and a growing security concern that will have catastrophic scientific and technological impacts, if not addressed early. If weaponised or exploited especially by the wrong hands, malware will undermine highly sophisticated critical systems supported by next-generation quantum architectures, for example, in defence, communications, energy, and space. This paper explores the fundamental nature and implications of quantum malware to enable the future development of appropriate mitigations and defences, thereby protecting critical infrastructure. By conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) that draws on knowledge frameworks such as ontologies and taxonomies to explore malware, this provides insights into how malicious behaviours can be translated into attacks on quantum technologies, thereby providing a lens to analyse the severity of malware against quantum technologies. This study employs the European Competency Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) as a guide to map malware behaviour to several competency layers, creating a foundation in this emerging field.",2025-09-24 00:06:17+00:00,2025-09-24 00:06:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19650v1
"Knock-Knock: Black-Box, Platform-Agnostic DRAM Address-Mapping Reverse Engineering","Modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) employ undocumented linear address-scrambling functions to obfuscate DRAM addressing, which complicates DRAM-aware performance optimizations and hinders proactive security analysis of DRAM-based attacks; most notably, Rowhammer. Although previous work tackled the issue of reversing physical-to-DRAM mapping, existing heuristic-based reverse-engineering approaches are partial, costly, and impractical for comprehensive recovery. This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation and provides efficient practical algorithms for black-box, complete physical-to-DRAM address-mapping recovery.   We first formulate the reverse-engineering problem within a linear algebraic model over the finite field GF(2). We characterize the timing fingerprints of row-buffer conflicts, proving a relationship between a bank addressing matrix and an empirically constructed matrix of physical addresses. Based on this characterization, we develop an efficient, noise-robust, and fully platform-agnostic algorithm to recover the full bank-mask basis in polynomial time, a significant improvement over the exponential search from previous works. We further generalize our model to complex row mappings, introducing new hardware-based hypotheses that enable the automatic recovery of a row basis instead of previous human-guided contributions.   Evaluations across embedded and server-class architectures confirm our method's effectiveness, successfully reconstructing known mappings and uncovering previously unknown scrambling functions. Our method provides a 99% recall and accuracy on all tested platforms. Most notably, Knock-Knock runs in under a few minutes, even on systems with more than 500GB of DRAM, showcasing the scalability of our method. Our approach provides an automated, principled pathway to accurate DRAM reverse engineering.",2025-09-23 20:49:48+00:00,2025-09-23 20:49:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19568v1
Why Speech Deepfake Detectors Won't Generalize: The Limits of Detection in an Open World,"Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices, sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a ``coverage debt"" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains (teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy safeguards.",2025-09-23 20:27:04+00:00,2025-09-23 20:27:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20405v1
LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics,"Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.",2025-09-23 15:03:05+00:00,2025-09-23 15:03:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117v1
Exploiting Page Faults for Covert Communication,"We present a novel mechanism to construct a covert channel based on page faults. A page fault is an event that occurs when a process or a thread tries to access a page of memory that is not currently mapped to its address space. The kernel typically responds to this event by performing a context switch to allow another process or thread to execute while the page is being fetched from the disk. We exploit this behavior to allow a malicious process to leak secret data to another process, bypassing the isolation mechanisms enforced by the operating system. These attacks do not leverage timers and are hardwareagnostic. Experimental results demonstrate that this attack can achieve a bit error rate of under 4%",2025-09-23 14:01:23+00:00,2025-09-23 14:01:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20398v1
Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).",2025-09-23 10:36:47+00:00,2025-09-23 10:36:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18886v1
Uncovering Privacy Vulnerabilities through Analytical Gradient Inversion Attacks,"Federated learning has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving technique for leveraging large-scale distributed datasets by sharing gradients instead of raw data. However, recent studies indicate that private training data can still be exposed through gradient inversion attacks. While earlier analytical methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing input data from fully connected layers, their effectiveness significantly diminishes when applied to convolutional layers, high-dimensional inputs, and scenarios involving multiple training examples. This paper extends our previous work \cite{eltaras2024r} and proposes three advanced algorithms to broaden the applicability of gradient inversion attacks. The first algorithm presents a novel data leakage method that efficiently exploits convolutional layer gradients, demonstrating that even with non-fully invertible activation functions, such as ReLU, training samples can be analytically reconstructed directly from gradients without the need to reconstruct intermediate layer outputs. Building on this foundation, the second algorithm extends this analytical approach to support high-dimensional input data, substantially enhancing its utility across complex real-world datasets. The third algorithm introduces an innovative analytical method for reconstructing mini-batches, addressing a critical gap in current research that predominantly focuses on reconstructing only a single training example. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on the weight constraints of convolutional layers, our approach emphasizes the pivotal role of gradient constraints, revealing that successful attacks can be executed with fewer than 5\% of the constraints previously deemed necessary in certain layers.",2025-09-28 06:47:02+00:00,2025-09-23 10:10:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18871v2
Blueprints of Trust: AI System Cards for End to End Transparency and Governance,"This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater transparency and accountability for AI systems.",2025-09-23 05:58:32+00:00,2025-09-23 05:58:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20394v1
OmniFed: A Modular Framework for Configurable Federated Learning from Edge to HPC,"Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing (HPC) where data is not centralized and privacy is crucial. We present OmniFed, a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies, mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration, learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration, mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments.

Compressed Permutation Oracles,"The analysis of quantum algorithms which query random, invertible permutations has been a long-standing challenge in cryptography. Many techniques which apply to random oracles fail, or are not known to generalize to this setting. As a result, foundational cryptographic constructions involving permutations often lack quantum security proofs. With the aim of closing this gap, we develop and prove soundness of a compressed permutation oracle. Our construction shares many of the attractive features of Zhandry's original compressed function oracle: the purification is a small list of input-output pairs which meaningfully reflect an algorithm's knowledge of the oracle.   We then apply this framework to show that the Feistel construction with seven rounds is a strong quantum PRP, resolving an open question of (Zhandry, 2012). We further re-prove essentially all known quantum query lower bounds in the random permutation model, notably the collision and preimage resistance of both Sponge and Davies-Meyer, hardness of double-sided zero search and sparse predicate search, and give new lower bounds for cycle finding and the one-more problem.",2025-09-23 03:13:48+00:00,2025-09-23 03:13:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18586v1
Examining I2P Resilience: Effect of Centrality-based Attack,"This study examines the robustness of I2P, a well-regarded anonymous and decentralized peer-to-peer network designed to ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and circumvention of censorship. Unlike its more widely researched counterpart, TOR, I2P's resilience has received less scholarly attention. Employing network analysis, this research evaluates I2P's susceptibility to adversarial percolation. By utilizing the degree centrality as a measure of nodes' influence in the network, the finding suggests the network is vulnerable to targeted disruptions. Before percolation, the network exhibited a density of 0.01065443 and an average path length of 6.842194. At the end of the percolation process, the density decreased by approximately 10%, and the average path length increased by 33%, indicating a decline in efficiency and connectivity. These results highlight that even decentralized networks, such as I2P, exhibit structural fragility under targeted attacks, emphasizing the need for improved design strategies to enhance resilience against adversarial disruptions.",2025-09-23 02:54:14+00:00,2025-09-23 02:54:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18572v1
Context Lineage Assurance for Non-Human Identities in Critical Multi-Agent Systems,"The proliferation of autonomous software agents necessitates rigorous frameworks for establishing secure and verifiable agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions, particularly when such agents are instantiated as non-human identities(NHIs). We extend the A2A paradigm [1 , 2] by introducing a cryptographically grounded mechanism for lineage verification, wherein the provenance and evolution of NHIs are anchored in append-only Merkle tree structures modeled after Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Unlike traditional A2A models that primarily secure point-to-point interactions, our approach enables both agents and external verifiers to cryptographically validate multi-hop provenance, thereby ensuring the integrity of the entire call chain.   A federated proof server acts as an auditor across one or more Merkle logs, aggregating inclusion proofs and consistency checks into compact, signed attestations that external parties can verify without access to the full execution trace. In parallel, we augment the A2A agent card to incorporate explicit identity verification primitives, enabling both peer agents and human approvers to authenticate the legitimacy of NHI representations in a standardized manner. Together, these contributions establish a cohesive model that integrates identity attestation, lineage verification, and independent proof auditing, thereby advancing the security posture of inter-agent ecosystems and providing a foundation for robust governance of NHIs in regulated environments such as FedRAMP.",2025-09-22 20:59:51+00:00,2025-09-22 20:59:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18415v1
VoxGuard: Evaluating User and Attribute Privacy in Speech via Membership Inference Attacks,"Voice anonymization aims to conceal speaker identity and attributes while preserving intelligibility, but current evaluations rely almost exclusively on Equal Error Rate (EER) that obscures whether adversaries can mount high-precision attacks. We argue that privacy should instead be evaluated in the low false-positive rate (FPR) regime, where even a small number of successful identifications constitutes a meaningful breach. To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.",2025-09-22 20:57:48+00:00,2025-09-22 20:57:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18413v1
Turning Hearsay into Discovery: Industrial 3D Printer Side Channel Information Translated to Stealing the Object Design,"The central security issue of outsourced 3D printing (aka AM: Additive Manufacturing), an industry that is expected to dominate manufacturing, is the protection of the digital design (containing the designers' model, which is their intellectual property) shared with the manufacturer. Here, we show, for the first time, that side-channel attacks are, in fact, a concrete serious threat to existing industrial grade 3D printers, enabling the reconstruction of the model printed (regardless of employing ways to directly conceal the design, e.g. by encrypting it in transit and before loading it into the printer). Previously, such attacks were demonstrated only on fairly simple FDM desktop 3D printers, which play a negligible role in manufacturing of valuable designs. We focus on the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process, which is popular for manufacturing net-shaped parts with both polymers and metals. We demonstrate how its individual actuators can be instrumented for the collection of power side-channel information during the printing process. We then present our approach to reconstruct the 3D printed model solely from the collected power side-channel data. Further, inspired by Differential Power Analysis, we developed a method to improve the quality of the reconstruction based on multiple traces. We tested our approach on two design models with different degrees of complexity. For different models, we achieved as high as 90.29~\% of True Positives and as low as 7.02~\% and 9.71~\% of False Positives and False Negatives by voxel-based volumetric comparison between reconstructed and original designs. The lesson learned from our attack is that the security of design files cannot solely rely on protecting the files themselves in an industrial environment, but must instead also rely on assuring no leakage of power, noise and similar signals to potential eavesdroppers in the printer's vicinity.",2025-09-22 19:46:21+00:00,2025-09-22 19:46:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18366v1
SoK: A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Fault Injection Attacks,"Fault Injection is the study of observing how systems behave under unusual stress, environmental or otherwise. In practice, fault injection involves testing the limits of computer systems and finding novel ways to potentially break cyber-physical security.   The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we provide a beginner-friendly introduction to this research topic and an in-depth taxonomy of fault injection techniques. Second, we highlight the current state-of-the-art and provide a cost-benefit analysis of each attack method. Third, for those interested in doing fault injection research, we provide a replication analysis of an existing vulnerability detection tool and identify a research focus for future work.",2025-09-22 19:03:34+00:00,2025-09-22 19:03:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18341v1
On Sybil-proofness in Restaking Networks,"Restaking protocols expand validator responsibilities beyond consensus, but their security depends on resistance to Sybil attacks. We introduce a formal framework for Sybil-proofness in restaking networks, distinguishing between two types of attacks, one in which other Sybil identities are kept out of an attack and one where multiple Sybil identities attack. We analyze marginal and multiplicative slashing mechanisms and characterize the conditions under which each deters Sybil strategies. We then prove an impossibility theorem: no slashing mechanism can simultaneously prevent both attack types. Finally, we study the impact of network structure through random graph models: while Erdös-Rényi networks remain Sybil-proof, even minimal heterogeneity in a two-block stochastic block model makes Sybil attacks profitable. These results reveal fundamental limits of mechanism design for restaking and highlight the critical role of network topology.",2025-09-22 19:01:26+00:00,2025-09-22 19:01:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18338v1
Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs,"Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.",2025-09-23 17:34:27+00:00,2025-09-22 17:30:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058v2
Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments,"Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.",2025-09-22 17:18:59+00:00,2025-09-22 17:18:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044v1
What if we could hot swap our Biometrics?,"What if you could really revoke your actual biometric identity, and install a new one, by live rewriting your biological self? We propose some novel mechanisms for hot swapping identity based in novel biotechnology. We discuss the potential positive use cases, and negative consequences if such technology was to become available and affordable. Biometrics are selected on the basis that they are supposed to be unfakeable, or at least not at reasonable cost. If they become easier to fake, it may be much cheaper to fake someone else's biometrics than it is for you to change your own biometrics if someone does copy yours. This potentially makes biometrics a bad trade-off for the user. At the time of writing, this threat is highly speculative, but we believe it is worth raising and considering the potential consequences.",2025-09-22 16:16:04+00:00,2025-09-22 16:16:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17962v1
B-Privacy: Defining and Enforcing Privacy in Weighted Voting,"In traditional, one-vote-per-person voting systems, privacy equates with ballot secrecy: voting tallies are published, but individual voters' choices are concealed.   Voting systems that weight votes in proportion to token holdings, though, are now prevalent in cryptocurrency and web3 systems. We show that these weighted-voting systems overturn existing notions of voter privacy. Our experiments demonstrate that even with secret ballots, publishing raw tallies often reveals voters' choices.   Weighted voting thus requires a new framework for privacy. We introduce a notion called B-privacy whose basis is bribery, a key problem in voting systems today. B-privacy captures the economic cost to an adversary of bribing voters based on revealed voting tallies.   We propose a mechanism to boost B-privacy by noising voting tallies. We prove bounds on its tradeoff between B-privacy and transparency, meaning reported-tally accuracy. Analyzing 3,582 proposals across 30 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), we find that the prevalence of large voters (""whales"") limits the effectiveness of any B-Privacy-enhancing technique. However, our mechanism proves to be effective in cases without extreme voting weight concentration: among proposals requiring coalitions of $\geq5$ voters to flip outcomes, our mechanism raises B-privacy by a geometric mean factor of $4.1\times$.   Our work offers the first principled guidance on transparency-privacy tradeoffs in weighted-voting systems, complementing existing approaches that focus on ballot secrecy and revealing fundamental constraints that voting weight concentration imposes on privacy mechanisms.",2025-09-30 21:20:52+00:00,2025-09-22 15:11:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17871v2
Modeling the Attack: Detecting AI-Generated Text by Quantifying Adversarial Perturbations,"The growth of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a huge dual-use problem, making it necessary to create dependable AI-generated text detection systems. Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against semantic attacks, an effect we term ""semantic evasion threshold"", where its True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation. It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine robustness in the adversarial arms race.",2025-09-22 13:03:53+00:00,2025-09-22 13:03:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02319v1
"Bridging Cybersecurity Practice and Law: a Hands-on, Scenario-Based Curriculum Using the NICE Framework to Foster Skill Development","In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity professionals play a pivotal role in safeguarding organizations from cyber threats. To secure their cyberspace, organizations are forced to adopt a cybersecurity framework such as the NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework). Although these frameworks are a good starting point for businesses and offer critical information to identify, prevent, and respond to cyber incidents, they can be difficult to navigate and implement, particularly for small-medium businesses (SMB). To help overcome this issue, this paper identifies the most frequent attack vectors to SMBs (Objective 1) and proposes a practical model of both technical and non-technical tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities (TKSA) from the NICE Framework for those attacks (Objective 2). The research develops a scenario-based curriculum. By immersing learners in realistic cyber threat scenarios, their practical understanding and preparedness in responding to cybersecurity incidents is enhanced (Objective 3). Finally, this work integrates practical experience and real-life skill development into the curriculum (Objective 4). SMBs can use the model as a guide to evaluate, equip their existing workforce, or assist in hiring new employees. In addition, educational institutions can use the model to develop scenario-based learning modules to adequately equip the emerging cybersecurity workforce for SMBs. Trainees will have the opportunity to practice both technical and legal issues in a simulated environment, thereby strengthening their ability to identify, mitigate, and respond to cyber threats effectively.",2025-09-21 22:36:30+00:00,2025-09-21 22:36:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17263v1
"Bribers, Bribers on The Chain, Is Resisting All in Vain? Trustless Consensus Manipulation Through Bribing Contracts","The long-term success of cryptocurrencies largely depends on the incentive compatibility provided to the validators. Bribery attacks, facilitated trustlessly via smart contracts, threaten this foundation. This work introduces, implements, and evaluates three novel and efficient bribery contracts targeting Ethereum validators. The first bribery contract enables a briber to fork the blockchain by buying votes on their proposed blocks. The second contract incentivizes validators to voluntarily exit the consensus protocol, thus increasing the adversary's relative staking power. The third contract builds a trustless bribery market that enables the briber to auction off their manipulative power over the RANDAO, Ethereum's distributed randomness beacon. Finally, we provide an initial game-theoretical analysis of one of the described bribery markets.",2025-09-21 18:12:17+00:00,2025-09-21 18:12:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17185v1
Unaligned Incentives: Pricing Attacks Against Blockchain Rollups,"Rollups have become the de facto scalability solution for Ethereum, securing more than $55B in assets. They achieve scale by executing transactions on a Layer 2 ledger, while periodically posting data and finalizing state on the Layer 1, either optimistically or via validity proofs. Their fees must simultaneously reflect the pricing of three resources: L2 costs (e.g., execution), L1 DA, and underlying L1 gas costs for batch settlement and proof verification. In this work, we identify critical mis-pricings in existing rollup transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) that allow for two powerful attacks. Firstly, an adversary can saturate the L2's DA batch capacity with compute-light data-heavy transactions, forcing low-gas transaction batches that enable both L2 DoS attacks, and finality-delay attacks. Secondly, by crafting prover killer transactions that maximize proving cycles relative to the gas charges, an adversary can effectively stall proof generation, delaying finality by hours and inflicting prover-side economic losses to the rollup at a minimal cost.   We analyze the above attack vectors across the major Ethereum rollups, quantifying adversarial costs and protocol losses. We find that the first attack enables periodic DoS on rollups, lasting up to 30 minutes, at a cost below 2 ETH for most rollups. Moreover, we identify three rollups that are exposed to indefinite DoS at a cost of approximately 0.8 to 2.7 ETH per hour. The attack can be further modified to increase finalization delays by a factor of about 1.45x to 2.73x, compared to direct L1 blob-stuffing, depending on the rollup's parameters. Furthermore, we find that the prover killer attack induces a finalization latency increase of about 94x. Finally, we propose comprehensive mitigations to prevent these attacks and suggest how some practical uses of multi-dimensional rollup TFMs can rectify the identified mis-pricing attacks.",2025-09-21 15:39:08+00:00,2025-09-21 15:39:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17126v1
MARS: A Malignity-Aware Backdoor Defense in Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks. Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron. To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing defenses.",2025-09-21 14:50:02+00:00,2025-09-21 14:50:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20383v1
In Numeris Veritas: An Empirical Measurement of Wi-Fi Integration in Industry,"Traditional air gaps in industrial systems are disappearing as IT technologies permeate the OT domain, accelerating the integration of wireless solutions like Wi-Fi. Next-generation Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11ax/be) meet performance demands for industrial use cases, yet their introduction raises significant security concerns. A critical knowledge gap exists regarding the empirical prevalence and security configuration of Wi-Fi in real-world industrial settings. This work addresses this by mining the global crowdsourced WiGLE database to provide a data-driven understanding. We create the first publicly available dataset of 1,087 high-confidence industrial Wi-Fi networks, examining key attributes such as SSID patterns, encryption methods, vendor types, and global distribution. Our findings reveal a growing adoption of Wi-Fi across industrial sectors but underscore alarming security deficiencies, including the continued use of weak or outdated security configurations that directly expose critical infrastructure. This research serves as a pivotal reference point, offering both a unique dataset and practical insights to guide future investigations into wireless security within industrial environments.",2025-09-21 09:01:58+00:00,2025-09-21 09:01:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16987v1
Temporal Logic-Based Multi-Vehicle Backdoor Attacks against Offline RL Agents in End-to-end Autonomous Driving,"Assessing the safety of autonomous driving (AD) systems against security threats, particularly backdoor attacks, is a stepping stone for real-world deployment. However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.",2025-10-11 21:46:17+00:00,2025-09-21 07:13:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16950v2
Security Vulnerabilities in Software Supply Chain for Autonomous Vehicles,"The interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) for critical missions, including transportation, rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance, and mapping, is growing rapidly due to their significant safety and mobility benefits. AVs consist of complex software systems that leverage artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion algorithms, and real-time data processing. Additionally, AVs are becoming increasingly reliant on open-source software supply chains, such as open-source packages, third-party software components, AI models, and third-party datasets. Software security best practices in the automotive sector are often an afterthought for developers. Thus, significant cybersecurity risks exist in the software supply chain of AVs, particularly when secure software development practices are not rigorously implemented. For example, Upstream's 2024 Automotive Cybersecurity Report states that 49.5% of cyberattacks in the automotive sector are related to exploiting security vulnerabilities in software systems. In this chapter, we analyze security vulnerabilities in open-source software components in AVs. We utilize static analyzers on popular open-source AV software, such as Autoware, Apollo, and openpilot. Specifically, this chapter covers: (1) prevalent software security vulnerabilities of AVs; and (2) a comparison of static analyzer outputs for different open-source AV repositories. The goal is to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers about the existing security flaws in the commonplace open-source software ecosystem in the AV domain. The findings would emphasize the necessity of security best practices earlier in the software development lifecycle to reduce cybersecurity risks, thereby ensuring system reliability, safeguarding user data, and maintaining public trust in an increasingly automated world.",2025-09-21 03:22:05+00:00,2025-09-21 03:22:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16899v1
DecipherGuard: Understanding and Deciphering Jailbreak Prompts for a Safer Deployment of Intelligent Software Systems,"Intelligent software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical sectors, raising concerns about their safety during runtime. Through an industry-academic collaboration when deploying an LLM-powered virtual customer assistant, a critical software engineering challenge emerged: how to enhance a safer deployment of LLM-powered software systems at runtime? While LlamaGuard, the current state-of-the-art runtime guardrail, offers protection against unsafe inputs, our study reveals a Defense Success Rate (DSR) drop of 24% under obfuscation- and template-based jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose DecipherGuard, a novel framework that integrates a deciphering layer to counter obfuscation-based prompts and a low-rank adaptation mechanism to enhance guardrail effectiveness against template-based attacks. Empirical evaluation on over 22,000 prompts demonstrates that DecipherGuard improves DSR by 36% to 65% and Overall Guardrail Performance (OGP) by 20% to 50% compared to LlamaGuard and two other runtime guardrails. These results highlight the effectiveness of DecipherGuard in defending LLM-powered software systems against jailbreak attacks during runtime.",2025-09-21 01:46:35+00:00,2025-09-21 01:46:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16870v1
AdaptiveGuard: Towards Adaptive Runtime Safety for LLM-Powered Software,"Guardrails are critical for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered software. Unlike traditional rule-based systems with limited, predefined input-output spaces that inherently constrain unsafe behavior, LLMs enable open-ended, intelligent interactions--opening the door to jailbreak attacks through user inputs. Guardrails serve as a protective layer, filtering unsafe prompts before they reach the LLM. However, prior research shows that jailbreak attacks can still succeed over 70% of the time, even against advanced models like GPT-4o. While guardrails such as LlamaGuard report up to 95% accuracy, our preliminary analysis shows their performance can drop sharply--to as low as 12%--when confronted with unseen attacks. This highlights a growing software engineering challenge: how to build a post-deployment guardrail that adapts dynamically to emerging threats? To address this, we propose AdaptiveGuard, an adaptive guardrail that detects novel jailbreak attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and learns to defend against them through a continual learning framework. Through empirical evaluation, AdaptiveGuard achieves 96% OOD detection accuracy, adapts to new attacks in just two update steps, and retains over 85% F1-score on in-distribution data post-adaptation, outperforming other baselines. These results demonstrate that AdaptiveGuard is a guardrail capable of evolving in response to emerging jailbreak strategies post deployment. We release our AdaptiveGuard and studied datasets at https://github.com/awsm-research/AdaptiveGuard to support further research.",2025-09-21 01:22:42+00:00,2025-09-21 01:22:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16861v1
Evaluating LLM Generated Detection Rules in Cybersecurity,"LLMs are increasingly pervasive in the security environment, with limited measures of their effectiveness, which limits trust and usefulness to security practitioners. Here, we present an open-source evaluation framework and benchmark metrics for evaluating LLM-generated cybersecurity rules. The benchmark employs a holdout set-based methodology to measure the effectiveness of LLM-generated security rules in comparison to a human-generated corpus of rules. It provides three key metrics inspired by the way experts evaluate security rules, offering a realistic, multifaceted evaluation of the effectiveness of an LLM-based security rule generator. This methodology is illustrated using rules from Sublime Security's detection team and those written by Sublime Security's Automated Detection Engineer (ADE), with a thorough analysis of ADE's skills presented in the results section.",2025-09-20 17:21:51+00:00,2025-09-20 17:21:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16749v1
Incentives and Outcomes in Bug Bounties,"Bug bounty programs have contributed significantly to security in technology firms in the last decade, but little is known about the role of reward incentives in producing useful outcomes. We analyze incentives and outcomes in Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), one of the world's largest bug bounty programs. We analyze the responsiveness of the quality and quantity of bugs received to changes in payments, focusing on a change in Google's reward amounts posted in July, 2024, in which reward amounts increased by up to 200% for the highest impact tier. Our empirical results show an increase in the volume of high-value bugs received after the reward increase, for which we also compute elasticities. We further break down the sources of this increase between veteran researchers and new researchers, showing that the reward increase both redirected the attention of veteran researchers and attracted new top security researchers into the program.",2025-09-20 12:02:45+00:00,2025-09-20 12:02:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16655v1
Delving into Cryptanalytic Extraction of PReLU Neural Networks,"The machine learning problem of model extraction was first introduced in 1991 and gained prominence as a cryptanalytic challenge starting with Crypto 2020. For over three decades, research in this field has primarily focused on ReLU-based neural networks. In this work, we take the first step towards the cryptanalytic extraction of PReLU neural networks, which employ more complex nonlinear activation functions than their ReLU counterparts. We propose a raw output-based parameter recovery attack for PReLU networks and extend it to more restrictive scenarios where only the top-m probability scores are accessible. Our attacks are rigorously evaluated through end-to-end experiments on diverse PReLU neural networks, including models trained on the MNIST dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical demonstration of PReLU neural network extraction across three distinct attack scenarios.",2025-09-20 10:43:17+00:00,2025-09-20 10:43:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16620v1
Reproducing a Security Risk Assessment Using Computer Aided Design,"Security risk assessment is essential in establishing the trustworthiness and reliability of modern systems. While various security risk assessment approaches exist, prevalent applications are ""pen and paper"" implementations that -- even if performed digitally using computers -- remain prone to authoring mistakes and inconsistencies. Computer-aided design approaches can transform security risk assessments into more rigorous and sustainable efforts. This is of value to both industrial practitioners and researchers, who practice security risk assessments to reflect on systems' designs and to contribute to the discipline's state-of-the-art. In this article, we report the application of a model-based security design tool to reproduce a previously reported security assessment. The main contributions are: 1) an independent attempt to reproduce a refereed article describing a real security risk assessment of a system; 2) comparison of a new computer-aided application with a previous non-computer-aided application, based on a published, real-world case study; 3) a showcase for the potential advantages -- for both practitioners and researchers -- of using computer-aided design approaches to analyze reports and to assess systems.",2025-09-20 09:36:23+00:00,2025-09-20 09:36:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16593v1
Towards Cost-Effective ZK-Rollups: Modeling and Optimization of Proving Infrastructure,"Zero-knowledge rollups rely on provers to generate multi-step state transition proofs under strict finality and availability constraints. These steps require expensive hardware (e.g., GPUs), and finality is reached only once all stages complete and results are posted on-chain. As rollups scale, staying economically viable becomes increasingly difficult due to rising throughput, fast finality demands, volatile gas prices, and dynamic resource needs. We base our study on Halo2-based proving systems and identify transactions per second (TPS), average gas usage, and finality time as key cost drivers. To address this, we propose a parametric cost model that captures rollup-specific constraints and ensures provers can keep up with incoming transaction load. We formulate this model as a constraint system and solve it using the Z3 SMT solver to find cost-optimal configurations. To validate our approach, we implement a simulator that detects lag and estimates operational costs. Our method shows a potential cost reduction of up to 70\%.",2025-09-20 09:03:54+00:00,2025-09-20 09:03:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16581v1
Polynomial Contrastive Learning for Privacy-Preserving Representation Learning on Graphs,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels. However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE, a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning.",2025-09-19 20:00:30+00:00,2025-09-19 20:00:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25205v1
Strategic Analysis of Just-In-Time Liquidity Provision in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers,"Liquidity providers (LPs) are essential figures in the operation of automated market makers (AMMs); in exchange for transaction fees, LPs lend the liquidity that allows AMMs to operate. While many prior works have studied the incentive structures of LPs in general, we currently lack a principled understanding of a special class of LPs known as Just-In-Time (JIT) LPs. These are strategic agents who momentarily supply liquidity for a single swap, in an attempt to extract disproportionately high fees relative to the remaining passive LPs. This paper provides the first formal, transaction-level model of JIT liquidity provision for a widespread class of AMMs known as Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs), as seen in Uniswap V3, for instance. We characterize the landscape of price impact and fee allocation in these systems, formulate and analyze a non-linear optimization problem faced by JIT LPs, and prove the existence of an optimal strategy. By fitting our optimal solution for JIT LPs to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools (particularly those with risky assets), there is a significant gap between observed and optimal JIT behavior. Existing JIT LPs often fail to account for price impact; doing so, we estimate they could increase earnings by up to 69% on average over small time windows. We also show that JIT liquidity, when deployed strategically, can improve market efficiency by reducing slippage for traders, albeit at the cost of eroding average passive LP profits by up to 44% per trade.",2025-09-19 17:03:29+00:00,2025-09-19 17:03:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16157v1
How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks,"We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an eight-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- appearing only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that, depending on the methodology, exclusive transactions account for between 77.2% and 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Moreover, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully attributed to persistent relationships between senders and builders: only between 7% and 8.4% of all on-chain exclusive transaction value originates from senders who route exclusively to one builder. Finally, we observe that transaction exclusivity is dynamic. Some transactions are exclusive at the start of a bidding cycle but later appear in blocks from multiple builders. Other transactions remain exclusive to a losing builder for two or three cycles before appearing in the public mempool. These transactions are therefore delayed and then exposed to potential attacks.",2025-11-14 14:17:33+00:00,2025-09-19 15:02:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052v3
"Hornet Node and the Hornet DSL: A Minimal, Executable Specification for Bitcoin Consensus","Bitcoin's consensus rules are encoded in the implementation of its reference client: ""The code is the spec."" Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.",2025-09-24 04:04:17+00:00,2025-09-19 08:30:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15754v2
Hybrid Deep Learning-Federated Learning Powered Intrusion Detection System for IoT/5G Advanced Edge Computing Network,"The exponential expansion of IoT and 5G-Advanced applications has enlarged the attack surface for DDoS, malware, and zero-day intrusions. We propose an intrusion detection system that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and an autoencoder (AE) bottleneck within a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework. The CNN-BiLSTM branch captures local and gated cross-feature interactions, while the AE emphasizes reconstruction-based anomaly sensitivity. Training occurs across edge devices without sharing raw data. On UNSW-NB15 (binary), the fused model attains AUC 99.59 percent and F1 97.36 percent; confusion-matrix analysis shows balanced error rates with high precision and recall. Average inference time is approximately 0.0476 ms per sample on our test hardware, which is well within the less than 10 ms URLLC budget, supporting edge deployment. We also discuss explainability, drift tolerance, and FL considerations for compliant, scalable 5G-Advanced IoT security.",2025-09-19 03:23:51+00:00,2025-09-19 03:23:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15555v1
Evil Vizier: Vulnerabilities of LLM-Integrated XR Systems,"Extended reality (XR) applications increasingly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user experience, scene understanding, and even generate executable XR content, and are often called ""AI glasses"". Despite these potential benefits, the integrated XR-LLM pipeline makes XR applications vulnerable to new forms of attacks. In this paper, we analyze LLM-Integated XR systems in the literature and in practice and categorize them along different dimensions from a systems perspective. Building on this categorization, we identify a common threat model and demonstrate a series of proof-of-concept attacks on multiple XR platforms that employ various LLM models (Meta Quest 3, Meta Ray-Ban, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 running Llama and GPT models). Although these platforms each implement LLM integration differently, they share vulnerabilities where an attacker can modify the public context surrounding a legitimate LLM query, resulting in erroneous visual or auditory feedback to users, thus compromising their safety or privacy, sowing confusion, or other harmful effects. To defend against these threats, we discuss mitigation strategies and best practices for developers, including an initial defense prototype, and call on the community to develop new protection mechanisms to mitigate these risks.",2025-09-27 21:10:45+00:00,2025-09-18 17:58:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15213v2
Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA RF Fingerprinting,"Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.",2025-09-19 01:16:33+00:00,2025-09-18 17:21:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15170v2
A Systematic Literature Review on Fundamental Technologies and Security Challenges in the Metaverse Platforms,"The Metaverse utilizes emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital twins to provide an immersive and interactive virtual experience. As Metaverse continues to evolve, it bring a range of security and privacy threats, such as identity management, data governance, and user interactions. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of the enabling technologies for the Metaverse. It also aims to provide a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats that may compromise its sustainability and user safety. We perform a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify key vulnerabilities and their countermeasures in Metaverse platforms. Metaverse offers a much larger attack surface compared to conventional digital platforms. Immersive, decentralized, and permanent characteristics of the Metaverse generate new vulnerabilities. Although there are many countermeasures to these vulnerabilities, most of them are theoretical or have not been tested in real-world environments. Our review highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.",2025-09-18 16:20:46+00:00,2025-09-18 16:20:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09621v1
Reconnecting Citizens to Politics via Blockchain - Starting the Debate,"Elections are not the only but arguably one of the most important pillars for the proper functioning of liberal democracies. Recent evidence across the globe shows that it is not straightforward to conduct them in a free and fair manner. One constant concern is the role of money in politics, more specifically, election campaign financing. Frequent scandals are proof of the difficulties encountered with current approaches to tackle the issue. Suggestions on how to overcome the problem exist but seem difficult to implement. With the help of blockchain technology we might be able to make a step forward. A separate crypto currency specifically designed to pay for costs of political campaigning and advertising could be introduced. Admittedly, at this stage, there are many open questions. However, under the assumption that blockchain technology is here to stay, it is an idea that deserves further exploration.",2025-09-18 15:39:41+00:00,2025-09-18 15:39:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16274v1
Blockchain-Enabled Explainable AI for Trusted Healthcare Systems,"This paper introduces a Blockchain-Integrated Explainable AI Framework (BXHF) for healthcare systems to tackle two essential challenges confronting health information networks: safe data exchange and comprehensible AI-driven clinical decision-making. Our architecture incorporates blockchain, ensuring patient records are immutable, auditable, and tamper-proof, alongside Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies that yield transparent and clinically relevant model predictions. By incorporating security assurances and interpretability requirements into a unified optimization pipeline, BXHF ensures both data-level trust (by verified and encrypted record sharing) and decision-level trust (with auditable and clinically aligned explanations). Its hybrid edge-cloud architecture allows for federated computation across different institutions, enabling collaborative analytics while protecting patient privacy. We demonstrate the framework's applicability through use cases such as cross-border clinical research networks, uncommon illness detection and high-risk intervention decision support. By ensuring transparency, auditability, and regulatory compliance, BXHF improves the credibility, uptake, and effectiveness of AI in healthcare, laying the groundwork for safer and more reliable clinical decision-making.",2025-09-18 14:17:19+00:00,2025-09-18 14:17:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14987v1
Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging,"The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from six heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a novel tool for the systematic assessment of privacy in tabular data, we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, minor issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, and geolocation) represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.",2025-09-18 12:56:03+00:00,2025-09-18 12:56:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278v1
Acoustic Simulation Framework for Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection,"Replay speech attacks pose a significant threat to voice-controlled systems, especially in smart environments where voice assistants are widely deployed. While multi-channel audio offers spatial cues that can enhance replay detection robustness, existing datasets and methods predominantly rely on single-channel recordings. In this work, we introduce an acoustic simulation framework designed to simulate multi-channel replay speech configurations using publicly available resources. Our setup models both genuine and spoofed speech across varied environments, including realistic microphone and loudspeaker impulse responses, room acoustics, and noise conditions. The framework employs measured loudspeaker directionalities during the replay attack to improve the realism of the simulation. We define two spoofing settings, which simulate whether a reverberant or an anechoic speech is used in the replay scenario, and evaluate the impact of omnidirectional and diffuse noise on detection performance. Using the state-of-the-art M-ALRAD model for replay speech detection, we demonstrate that synthetic data can support the generalization capabilities of the detector across unseen enclosures.",2025-09-18 09:38:58+00:00,2025-09-18 09:38:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14789v1
Enterprise AI Must Enforce Participant-Aware Access Control,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings where they interact with multiple users and are trained or fine-tuned on sensitive internal data. While fine-tuning enhances performance by internalizing domain knowledge, it also introduces a critical security risk: leakage of confidential training data to unauthorized users. These risks are exacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.   We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries can exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive information by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement. We show that existing defenses, including prompt sanitization, output filtering, system isolation, and training-level privacy mechanisms, are fundamentally probabilistic and fail to offer robust protection against such attacks.   We take the position that only a deterministic and rigorous enforcement of fine-grained access control during both fine-tuning and RAG-based inference can reliably prevent the leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.   We introduce a framework centered on the principle that any content used in training, retrieval, or generation by an LLM is explicitly authorized for \emph{all users involved in the interaction}. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful paradigm shift for building secure multi-user LLM systems that are grounded in classical access control but adapted to the unique challenges of modern AI workflows. Our solution has been deployed in Microsoft Copilot Tuning, a product offering that enables organizations to fine-tune models using their own enterprise-specific data.",2025-09-18 04:30:49+00:00,2025-09-18 04:30:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14608v1
Threats and Security Strategies for IoMT Infusion Pumps,"The integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems has transformed patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, enhanced diagnostics, and enhanced operational efficiency. However, this increased connectivity has also expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, raising significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This study focuses on the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of IoMT infusion pumps, which are critical devices in modern healthcare. Through a targeted literature review of the past five years, we analyzed seven current studies from a pool of 132 papers to identify security vulnerabilities. Our findings indicate that infusion pumps face vulnerabilities such as device-level flaws, authentication and access control issues, network and communication weaknesses, data security and privacy risks, and operational or organizational challenges that can expose them to lateral attacks within healthcare networks. Our analysis synthesizes findings from seven recent studies to clarify how and why infusion pumps remain vulnerable in each of these areas. By categorizing the security gaps, we highlight critical risk patterns and their implications. This work underscores the scope of the issue and provides a structured understanding that is valuable for healthcare IT professionals and device manufacturers. Ultimately, the findings can inform the development of targeted, proactive security strategies to better safeguard infusion pumps and protect patient well-being.",2025-09-18 04:29:07+00:00,2025-09-18 04:29:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14604v1
"ATLANTIS: AI-driven Threat Localization, Analysis, and Triage Intelligence System","We present ATLANTIS, the cyber reasoning system developed by Team Atlanta that won 1st place in the Final Competition of DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) at DEF CON 33 (August 2025). AIxCC (2023-2025) challenged teams to build autonomous cyber reasoning systems capable of discovering and patching vulnerabilities at the speed and scale of modern software. ATLANTIS integrates large language models (LLMs) with program analysis -- combining symbolic execution, directed fuzzing, and static analysis -- to address limitations in automated vulnerability discovery and program repair. Developed by researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Samsung Research, KAIST, and POSTECH, the system addresses core challenges: scaling across diverse codebases from C to Java, achieving high precision while maintaining broad coverage, and producing semantically correct patches that preserve intended behavior.

ZKProphet: Understanding Performance of Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs,"Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are protocols which construct cryptographic proofs to demonstrate knowledge of a secret input in a computation without revealing any information about the secret. ZKPs enable novel applications in private and verifiable computing such as anonymized cryptocurrencies and blockchain scaling and have seen adoption in several real-world systems. Prior work has accelerated ZKPs on GPUs by leveraging the inherent parallelism in core computation kernels like Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM). However, we find that a systematic characterization of execution bottlenecks in ZKPs, as well as their scalability on modern GPU architectures, is missing in the literature. This paper presents ZKProphet, a comprehensive performance study of Zero-Knowledge Proofs on GPUs. Following massive speedups of MSM, we find that ZKPs are bottlenecked by kernels like Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), as they account for up to 90% of the proof generation latency on GPUs when paired with optimized MSM implementations. Available NTT implementations under-utilize GPU compute resources and often do not employ architectural features like asynchronous compute and memory operations. We observe that the arithmetic operations underlying ZKPs execute exclusively on the GPU's 32-bit integer pipeline and exhibit limited instruction-level parallelism due to data dependencies. Their performance is thus limited by the available integer compute units. While one way to scale the performance of ZKPs is adding more compute units, we discuss how runtime parameter tuning for optimizations like precomputed inputs and alternative data representations can extract additional speedup. With this work, we provide the ZKP community a roadmap to scale performance on GPUs and construct definitive GPU-accelerated ZKPs for their application requirements and available hardware resources.",2025-09-17 22:52:19+00:00,2025-09-17 22:52:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22684v1
Beyond Classification: Evaluating LLMs for Fine-Grained Automatic Malware Behavior Auditing,"Automated malware classification has achieved strong detection performance. Yet, malware behavior auditing seeks causal and verifiable explanations of malicious activities -- essential not only to reveal what malware does but also to substantiate such claims with evidence. This task is challenging, as adversarial intent is often hidden within complex, framework-heavy applications, making manual auditing slow and costly. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help address this gap, but their auditing potential remains largely unexplored due to three limitations: (1) scarce fine-grained annotations for fair assessment; (2) abundant benign code obscuring malicious signals; and (3) unverifiable, hallucination-prone outputs undermining attribution credibility. To close this gap, we introduce MalEval, a comprehensive framework for fine-grained Android malware auditing, designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs support auditing under real-world constraints. MalEval provides expert-verified reports and an updated sensitive API list to mitigate ground truth scarcity and reduce noise via static reachability analysis. Function-level structural representations serve as intermediate attribution units for verifiable evaluation. Building on this, we define four analyst-aligned tasks -- function prioritization, evidence attribution, behavior synthesis, and sample discrimination -- together with domain-specific metrics and a unified workload-oriented score. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs on a curated dataset of recent malware and misclassified benign apps, offering the first systematic assessment of their auditing capabilities. MalEval reveals both promising potential and critical limitations across audit stages, providing a reproducible benchmark and foundation for future research on LLM-enhanced malware behavior auditing. MalEval is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengXR930/MalEval.git",2025-09-17 18:05:21+00:00,2025-09-17 18:05:21+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14335v1

Cybersecurity AI: Humanoid Robots as Attack Vectors,"We present a systematic security assessment of the Unitree G1 humanoid showing it operates simultaneously as a covert surveillance node and can be purposed as an active cyber operations platform. Initial access can be achieved by exploiting the BLE provisioning protocol which contains a critical command injection vulnerability allowing root access via malformed Wi-Fi credentials, exploitable using hardcoded AES keys shared across all units. Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.",2025-09-23 10:19:17+00:00,2025-09-17 16:18:53+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14139v3
The Cybersecurity of a Humanoid Robot,"The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics presents unprecedented cybersecurity challenges that existing theoretical frameworks fail to adequately address. This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of a production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract security models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static analysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a complex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer proprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in design, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of static cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More significantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting detailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and actuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or notification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the Unitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud infrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from covert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that securing humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI (CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber convergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust security standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to operational systems in critical domains.",2025-09-17 15:37:09+00:00,2025-09-17 15:37:09+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14096v1
Piquant$\varepsilon$: Private Quantile Estimation in the Two-Server Model,"Quantiles are key in distributed analytics, but computing them over sensitive data risks privacy. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers strong protection but lower accuracy than central DP, which assumes a trusted aggregator. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) can bridge this gap, but generic MPC solutions face scalability challenges due to large domains, complex secure operations, and multi-round interactions.   We present Piquant$\varepsilon$, a system for privacy-preserving estimation of multiple quantiles in a distributed setting without relying on a trusted server. Piquant$\varepsilon$ operates under the malicious threat model and achieves accuracy of the central DP model. Built on the two-server model, Piquant$\varepsilon$ uses a novel strategy of releasing carefully chosen intermediate statistics, reducing MPC complexity while preserving end-to-end DP. Empirically, Piquant$\varepsilon$ estimates 5 quantiles on 1 million records in under a minute with domain size $10^9$, achieving up to $10^4$-fold higher accuracy than LDP, and up to $\sim 10\times$ faster runtime compared to baselines.",2025-09-17 14:34:40+00:00,2025-09-17 14:34:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14035v1
Differential Privacy in Federated Learning: Mitigating Inference Attacks with Randomized Response,"Machine learning models used for distributed architectures consisting of servers and clients require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy. Data obtained from clients are collected on a central server for model training. However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about security and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture has been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model using its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the central server. The server then combines the received models using federated aggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is distributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical manner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security, certain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the obtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data leakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the aforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was conducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA) algorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy was implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the trade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon values. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class prediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of privacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between security and performance must be carefully considered.",2025-09-17 13:59:38+00:00,2025-09-17 13:59:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13987v1
Homomorphic encryption schemes based on coding theory and polynomials,"Homomorphic encryption is a powerful cryptographic tool that enables secure computations on the private data. It evaluates any function for any operation securely on the encrypted data without knowing its corresponding plaintext. For original data $p$, $c$ denotes the ciphertext of the original plaintext $p$, i.e. $c = Encrypt_k(p)$. This is crucial for any sensitive application running in the Cloud, because we must protect data privacy even in the case when the server has falled victim to a cyber attack. The encryption scheme $Encrypt_k$ is said to be homomorphic with respect to some set of operations $\mathcal{O}$, if for any operation $\circ \in \mathcal{O}$ one can compute $Encrypt_k(p_1 \circ p_2)$ from $Encrypt_k(p_1) \circ Encrypt_k(p_2)$. Those schemes come in three forms: somewhat, partially and fully homomorphic.

Scrub It Out! Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning,"While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and efficiently?   We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining. Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods, and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.",2025-09-17 07:12:35+00:00,2025-09-17 07:12:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755v1
Secure UAV-assisted Federated Learning: A Digital Twin-Driven Approach with Zero-Knowledge Proofs,"Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity as a privacy-preserving method of training machine learning models on decentralized networks. However to ensure reliable operation of UAV-assisted FL systems, issues like as excessive energy consumption, communication inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities must be solved. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates Digital Twin (DT) technology and Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning (zkFed) to tackle these challenges. UAVs act as mobile base stations, allowing scattered devices to train FL models locally and upload model updates for aggregation. By incorporating DT technology, our approach enables real-time system monitoring and predictive maintenance, improving UAV network efficiency. Additionally, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) strengthen security by allowing model verification without exposing sensitive data. To optimize energy efficiency and resource management, we introduce a dynamic allocation strategy that adjusts UAV flight paths, transmission power, and processing rates based on network conditions. Using block coordinate descent and convex optimization techniques, our method significantly reduces system energy consumption by up to 29.6% compared to conventional FL approaches. Simulation results demonstrate improved learning performance, security, and scalability, positioning this framework as a promising solution for next-generation UAV-based intelligent networks.",2025-09-17 02:10:34+00:00,2025-09-17 02:10:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13634v1
Privacy Preserving In-Context-Learning Framework for Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models. The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.

Demystifying Progressive Web Application Permission Systems,"Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) blend the advantages of web and native apps, offering features like offline access, push notifications, and installability. Beyond these, modern PWAs are increasingly granted system-level capabilities such as auto-start on login and shared context with native applications. However, their permission management remains poorly defined and inconsistently implemented across platforms and browsers.   To investigate these gaps, we developed Permissioner, a cross-platform analysis tool, and conducted a systematic study of PWA permissions. Our analysis uncovered critical issues of inconsistency, incompleteness, and unclear boundaries in permission enforcement, leading to various attacks including permission leakage, device identification, and Permission API abuse. We further examined why some browsers resist adopting more granular permission controls, identifying trade-offs involving usability, compatibility, and platform limitations. Through collaboration with browser vendors, several issues reported in our findings were acknowledged and resolved, notably by Firefox and Chrome. Our work highlights the urgent need for a unified, robust permission model for PWAs and provides actionable guidance toward achieving this goal.",2025-09-16 22:03:47+00:00,2025-09-16 22:03:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13563v1
GuardianPWA: Enhancing Security Throughout the Progressive Web App Installation Lifecycle,"Progressive Web App (PWA) installation is critical for integrating web and mobile app functionalities, offering a seamless user experience. However, ensuring the security of the PWA installation lifecycle is essential for maintaining user trust and privacy. This paper introduces the GUARDIANPWA framework, a comprehensive approach to analyzing the PWA installation mechanism based on the CIA security principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and identifying areas where browser vendors fail to comply with these principles. Our study revealed 203 instances of non-compliance with security principles, highlighting how these irregularities in the PWA installation lifecycle can lead to potential violations of user privacy. For instance, in Firefox, PWAs installed in private mode incorrectly appear in normal mode, risking user confidentiality. Additionally, 29,465 PWAs are at risk because Samsung Internet does not display origins when PWAs navigate to third-party websites, undermining integrity. These findings were reported to browser vendors, leading to Firefox acknowledging four issues, resolving one, and planning to resolve two others. GUARDIANPWA supports developers by analyzing PWA manifest files for syntactic and semantic correctness, offering actionable recommendations, and helping to create PWAs that align with security best practices. By using GUARDIANPWA, developers and users can address critical security gaps and enhance compliance with CIA principles throughout the PWA installation lifecycle.",2025-09-16 22:01:18+00:00,2025-09-16 22:01:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13561v1
Defining Security in Quantum Key Distribution,"The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is quantified by a parameter $\varepsilon>0$, which -- under well-defined physical assumptions -- can be bounded explicitly. This contrasts with computationally secure schemes, where security claims are only asymptotic (i.e., under standard complexity assumptions, one only knows that $\varepsilon \to 0$ as the key size grows, but has no explicit bound). Here we explain the definition and interpretation of $\varepsilon$-security. Adopting an axiomatic approach, we show that $\varepsilon$ can be understood as the maximum probability of a security failure. Finally, we review and address several criticisms of this definition that have appeared in the literature.",2025-09-16 18:00:01+00:00,2025-09-16 18:00:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13405v1
On the Out-of-Distribution Backdoor Attack for Federated Learning,"Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL. To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$, which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the main task.   To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce $\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL. Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.",2025-09-16 16:23:39+00:00,2025-09-16 16:23:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13219v1
Trustworthy and Confidential SBOM Exchange,"Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become a regulatory requirement for improving software supply chain security and trust by means of transparency regarding components that make up software artifacts. However, enterprise and regulated software vendors commonly wish to restrict who can view confidential software metadata recorded in their SBOMs due to intellectual property or security vulnerability information. To address this tension between transparency and confidentiality, we propose Petra, an SBOM exchange system that empowers software vendors to interoperably compose and distribute redacted SBOM data using selective encryption. Petra enables software consumers to search redacted SBOMs for answers to specific security questions without revealing information they are not authorized to access. Petra leverages a format-agnostic, tamper-evident SBOM representation to generate efficient and confidentiality-preserving integrity proofs, allowing interested parties to cryptographically audit and establish trust in redacted SBOMs. Exchanging redacted SBOMs in our Petra prototype requires less than 1 extra KB per SBOM, and SBOM decryption account for at most 1% of the performance overhead during an SBOM query.",2025-09-16 16:21:27+00:00,2025-09-16 16:21:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13217v1

Digital Sovereignty Control Framework for Military AI-based Cyber Security,"In today's evolving threat landscape, ensuring digital sovereignty has become mandatory for military organizations, especially given their increased development and investment in AI-driven cyber security solutions. To this end, a multi-angled framework is proposed in this article in order to define and assess digital sovereign control of data and AI-based models for military cyber security. This framework focuses on aspects such as context, autonomy, stakeholder involvement, and mitigation of risks in this domain. Grounded on the concepts of digital sovereignty and data sovereignty, the framework aims to protect sensitive defence assets against threats such as unauthorized access, ransomware, and supply-chain attacks. This approach reflects the multifaceted nature of digital sovereignty by preserving operational autonomy, assuring security and safety, securing privacy, and fostering ethical compliance of both military systems and decision-makers. At the same time, the framework addresses interoperability challenges among allied forces, strategic and legal considerations, and the integration of emerging technologies by considering a multidisciplinary approach that enhances the resilience and preservation of control over (critical) digital assets. This is done by adopting a design oriented research where systematic literature review is merged with critical thinking and analysis of field incidents in order to assure the effectivity and realism of the framework proposed.",2025-09-16 13:29:26+00:00,2025-09-16 13:29:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13072v1
MIA-EPT: Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data,"Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST 2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data, challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently privacy-preserving.

xOffense: An AI-driven autonomous penetration testing framework with offensive knowledge-enhanced LLMs and multi agent systems,"This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.

Universal share based quantum multi secret image sharing scheme,"Image security for information has become increasingly critical as internet become more prevalent due to hacking and unauthorized access. To ensure the security of confidential image data, image encryption using visual cryptography plays a crucial role. To share multiple images using visual cryptography, the company organizer utilizes the concept of a universal or common share. Likewise, quantum computing is an emerging technology that facilitates secure communication.

A Graph-Based Approach to Alert Contextualisation in Security Operations Centres,"Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign activity to prioritise what needs further analysis. This paper proposes a graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts, we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents, providing analysts with additional insights.",2025-09-18 08:05:45+00:00,2025-09-16 10:20:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12923v2
Beyond Data Privacy: New Privacy Risks for Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.",2025-09-16 09:46:09+00:00,2025-09-16 09:46:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14278v1
A Systematic Evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods for the Security of Code LLMs,"Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerate software development. However, their frequent generation of insecure code presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover, prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502 attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness.

QKD Oracles for Authenticated Key Exchange,"Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) establishes shared ('symmetric') cryptographic keys which are essential for secure online communication. AKE protocols can be constructed from public-key cryptography like Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). Another approach is to use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to establish a symmetric key, which uses quantum communication. Combining post-quantum AKE and QKD appropriately may provide security against quantum attacks even if only one of the two approaches turns out to be secure.   We provide an extensive review of existing security analyses for combined AKE and their formal security models, and identify some gaps in their treatment of QKD key IDs. In particular, improper handling of QKD key IDs leads to Dependent-Key attacks on AKE.   As our main conceptual contribution, we model QKD as an oracle that closely resembles the standard ETSI 014 QKD interface. We demonstrate the usability of our QKD oracle for cryptographic security analyses by integrating it into a prominent security model for AKE, called CK+ model, thereby obtaining a security model for combined AKE that catches Dependent-Key attacks. In this model, we formally prove security of a new protocol that combines QKD with a triple-KEM handshake. This is the first provably secure hybrid protocol that maintains information-theoretic security of QKD.",2025-09-15 21:55:55+00:00,2025-09-15 21:55:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12478v1
Redefining Website Fingerprinting Attacks With Multiagent LLMs,"Website Fingerprinting (WFP) uses deep learning models to classify encrypted network traffic to infer visited websites. While historically effective, prior methods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications (SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages, undermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks the behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that users exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing traffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral entropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust performance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop session-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a scalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents. These multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to simulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than human collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from 20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance across human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under 10\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In contrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\% range, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate that for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data quality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is essential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior.",2025-09-15 21:17:04+00:00,2025-09-15 21:17:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12462v1
Amulet: a Python Library for Assessing Interactions Among ML Defenses and Risks,"Machine learning (ML) models are susceptible to various risks to security, privacy, and fairness. Most defenses are designed to protect against each risk individually (intended interactions) but can inadvertently affect susceptibility to other unrelated risks (unintended interactions). We introduce Amulet, the first Python library for evaluating both intended and unintended interactions among ML defenses and risks. Amulet is comprehensive by including representative attacks, defenses, and metrics; extensible to new modules due to its modular design; consistent with a user-friendly API template for inputs and outputs; and applicable for evaluating novel interactions. By satisfying all four properties, Amulet offers a unified foundation for studying how defenses interact, enabling the first systematic evaluation of unintended interactions across multiple risks.",2025-11-07 14:22:21+00:00,2025-09-15 19:27:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12386v2
Early Approaches to Adversarial Fine-Tuning for Prompt Injection Defense: A 2022 Study of GPT-3 and Contemporary Models,"This paper documents early research conducted in 2022 on defending against prompt injection attacks in large language models, providing historical context for the evolution of this critical security domain. This research focuses on two adversarial attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs): prompt injection and goal hijacking. We examine how to construct these attacks, test them on various LLMs, and compare their effectiveness. We propose and evaluate a novel defense technique called Adversarial Fine-Tuning. Our results show that, without this defense, the attacks succeeded 31\% of the time on GPT-3 series models. When using our Adversarial Fine-Tuning approach, attack success rates were reduced to near zero for smaller GPT-3 variants (Ada, Babbage, Curie), though we note that subsequent research has revealed limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses. We also find that more flexible models exhibit greater vulnerability to these attacks. Consequently, large models such as GPT-3 Davinci are more vulnerable than smaller models like GPT-2. While the specific models tested are now superseded, the core methodology and empirical findings contributed to the foundation of modern prompt injection defense research, including instruction hierarchy systems and constitutional AI approaches.",2025-09-15 19:14:01+00:00,2025-09-15 19:14:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14271v1
LOKI: Proactively Discovering Online Scam Websites by Mining Toxic Search Queries,"Online e-commerce scams, ranging from shopping scams to pet scams, globally cause millions of dollars in financial damage every year. In response, the security community has developed highly accurate detection systems able to determine if a website is fraudulent. However, finding candidate scam websites that can be passed as input to these downstream detection systems is challenging: relying on user reports is inherently reactive and slow, and proactive systems issuing search engine queries to return candidate websites suffer from low coverage and do not generalize to new scam types. In this paper, we present LOKI, a system designed to identify search engine queries likely to return a high fraction of fraudulent websites. LOKI implements a keyword scoring model grounded in Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) and feature distillation from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). We rigorously validate LOKI across 10 major scam categories and demonstrate a 20.58 times improvement in discovery over both heuristic and data-driven baselines across all categories. Leveraging a small seed set of only 1,663 known scam sites, we use the keywords identified by our method to discover 52,493 previously unreported scams in the wild. Finally, we show that LOKI generalizes to previously-unseen scam categories, highlighting its utility in surfacing emerging threats.",2025-09-15 17:44:08+00:00,2025-09-15 17:44:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12181v1
Poison to Detect: Detection of Targeted Overfitting in Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralised clients while keeping local data private, making it a widely adopted privacy-enhancing technology (PET). Despite its privacy benefits, FL remains vulnerable to privacy attacks, including those targeting specific clients. In this paper, we study an underexplored threat where a dishonest orchestrator intentionally manipulates the aggregation process to induce targeted overfitting in the local models of specific clients. Whereas many studies in this area predominantly focus on reducing the amount of information leakage during training, we focus on enabling an early client-side detection of targeted overfitting, thereby allowing clients to disengage before significant harm occurs. In line with this, we propose three detection techniques - (a) label flipping, (b) backdoor trigger injection, and (c) model fingerprinting - that enable clients to verify the integrity of the global aggregation. We evaluated our methods on multiple datasets under different attack scenarios. Our results show that the three methods reliably detect targeted overfitting induced by the orchestrator, but they differ in terms of computational complexity, detection latency, and false-positive rates.",2025-09-15 14:23:39+00:00,2025-09-15 14:23:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11974v1
NeuroStrike: Neuron-Level Attacks on Aligned LLMs,"Safety alignment is critical for the ethical deployment of large language models (LLMs), guiding them to avoid generating harmful or unethical content. Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability.   This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.",2025-11-17 13:02:51+00:00,2025-09-15 12:38:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11864v2
Off-Path TCP Exploits: PMTUD Breaks TCP Connection Isolation in IP Address Sharing Scenarios,"Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) and IP address sharing are integral aspects of modern Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate the security vulnerabilities associated with PMTUD within the context of prevalent IP address sharing practices. We reveal that PMTUD is inadequately designed to handle IP address sharing, creating vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to perform off-path TCP hijacking attacks. We demonstrate that by observing the path MTU value determined by a server for a public IP address (shared among multiple devices), an off-path attacker on the Internet, in collaboration with a malicious device, can infer the sequence numbers of TCP connections established by other legitimate devices sharing the same IP address. This vulnerability enables the attacker to perform off-path TCP hijacking attacks, significantly compromising the security of the affected TCP connections. Our attack involves first identifying a target TCP connection originating from the shared IP address, followed by inferring the sequence numbers of the identified connection. We thoroughly assess the impacts of our attack under various network configurations. Experimental results reveal that the attack can be executed within an average time of 220 seconds, achieving a success rate of 70%.Case studies, including SSH DoS, FTP traffic poisoning, and HTTP injection, highlight the threat it poses to various applications. Additionally, we evaluate our attack across 50 real-world networks with IP address sharing--including public Wi-Fi, VPNs, and 5G--and find 38 vulnerable. Finally, we responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities, receive recognition from organizations such as IETF, Linux, and Cisco, and propose our countermeasures.",2025-09-15 12:19:02+00:00,2025-09-15 12:19:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11833v1
Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems Based on Cross-Domain Representation Learning,"Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in industry, and their security and stability are very important. Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.",2025-09-15 11:12:09+00:00,2025-09-15 11:12:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11786v1
Removal Attack and Defense on AI-generated Content Latent-based Watermarking,"Digital watermarks can be embedded into AI-generated content (AIGC) by initializing the generation process with starting points sampled from a secret distribution. When combined with pseudorandom error-correcting codes, such watermarked outputs can remain indistinguishable from unwatermarked objects, while maintaining robustness under whitenoise. In this paper, we go beyond indistinguishability and investigate security under removal attacks. We demonstrate that indistinguishability alone does not necessarily guarantee resistance to adversarial removal. Specifically, we propose a novel attack that exploits boundary information leaked by the locations of watermarked objects. This attack significantly reduces the distortion required to remove watermarks -- by up to a factor of $15 \times$ compared to a baseline whitenoise attack under certain settings. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a defense mechanism that applies a secret transformation to hide the boundary, and prove that the secret transformation effectively rendering any attacker's perturbations equivalent to those of a naive whitenoise adversary. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on multiple versions of Stable Diffusion, validate the effectiveness of both the attack and the proposed defense, highlighting the importance of addressing boundary leakage in latent-based watermarking schemes.",2025-11-12 10:28:20+00:00,2025-09-15 09:56:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11745v3
Time-Based State-Management of Hash-Based Signature CAs for VPN-Authentication,"Advances in quantum computing necessitate migrating the entire technology stack to post-quantum cryptography. This includes IPsec-based VPN connection authentication. Although there is an RFC draft for post-quantum authentication in this setting, the draft does not consider (stateful) hash-based signatures despite their small signature size and trusted long-term security.   We propose a design with time-based state-management that assigns VPN devices a certificate authority (CA) based on the hash-based signature scheme XMSS. The CA then issues leaf certificates which are based on classical cryptography but have a short validity time, e. g., four hours. It is to be expected that even large quantum computers will take significantly longer to break the cryptography, making the design quantum-secure. We propose strategies to make the timekeeping more resilient to faults and tampering, as well as strategies to recognize a wrong system time, minimize its potential damage, and quickly recover.   The result is an OpenBSD implementation of a quantum-safe and, regarding the leaf certificates, highly flexible VPN authentication design that requires significantly less bandwidth and computational resources compared to existing alternatives.",2025-09-15 08:49:08+00:00,2025-09-15 08:49:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11695v1
An Unsupervised Learning Approach For A Reliable Profiling Of Cyber Threat Actors Reported Globally Based On Complete Contextual Information Of Cyber Attacks,"Cyber attacks are rapidly increasing with the advancement of technology and there is no protection for our information. To prevent future cyberattacks it is critical to promptly recognize cyberattacks and establish strong defense mechanisms against them. To respond to cybersecurity threats immediately, it is essential to examine the attackers skills, knowledge, and behaviors with the goal of evaluating their impact on the system and comprehending the traits associated with these attacks. Creating a profile of cyber threat actors based on their traits or patterns of behavior can help to create effective defenses against cyberattacks in advance. In the current literature, multiple supervised machine learning based approaches considered a smaller number of features for attacker profiling that are reported in textual cyber threat incident documents although these profiles have been developed based on the security experts own perception, we cannot rely on them. Supervised machine learning approaches strictly depend upon the structure data set. This usually leads to a two step process where we first have to establish a structured data set before we can analyze it and then employ it to construct defense mechanisms, which takes time. In this paper, an unsupervised efficient agglomerative hierarchal clustering technique is proposed for profiling cybercriminal groups based on their comprehensive contextual threat information in order to address the aforementioned issues. The main objective of this report is to identify the relationship between cyber threat actors based on their common features, aggregate them, and also profile cyber criminal groups.",2025-09-15 08:32:59+00:00,2025-09-15 08:32:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11683v1
Secure Human Oversight of AI: Exploring the Attack Surface of Human Oversight,"Human oversight of AI is promoted as a safeguard against risks such as inaccurate outputs, system malfunctions, or violations of fundamental rights, and is mandated in regulation like the European AI Act. Yet debates on human oversight have largely focused on its effectiveness, while overlooking a critical dimension: the security of human oversight. We argue that human oversight creates a new attack surface within the safety, security, and accountability architecture of AI operations. Drawing on cybersecurity perspectives, we analyze attack vectors that threaten the requirements of effective human oversight, thereby undermining the safety of AI operations. Such attacks may target the AI system, its communication with oversight personnel, or the personnel themselves. We then outline hardening strategies to mitigate these risks. Our contributions are: (1) introducing a security perspective on human oversight, and (2) providing an overview of attack vectors and hardening strategies to enable secure human oversight of AI.",2025-09-15 08:22:11+00:00,2025-09-15 08:22:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12290v1
Cyber Attack Mitigation Framework for Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks in Fog Computing,"Innovative solutions to cyber security issues are shaped by the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats. Automating the mitigation of these threats can be achieved through a new methodology that addresses the domain of mitigation automation, which is often overlooked. This literature overview emphasizes the lack of scholarly work focusing specifically on automated cyber threat mitigation, particularly in addressing challenges beyond detection. The proposed methodology comprise of the development of an automatic cyber threat mitigation framework tailored for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This framework adopts a multi-layer security approach, utilizing smart devices at the device layer, and leveraging fog network and cloud computing layers for deeper understanding and technological adaptability. Initially, firewall rule-based packet inspection is conducted on simulated attack traffic to filter out DoS packets, forwarding legitimate packets to the fog. The methodology emphasizes the integration of fog detection through statistical and behavioral analysis, specification-based detection, and deep packet inspection, resulting in a comprehensive cyber protection system. Furthermore, cloud-level inspection is performed to confirm and mitigate attacks using firewalls, enhancing strategic defense and increasing robustness against cyber threats. These enhancements enhance understanding of the research framework's practical implementation and assessment strategies, substantiating its importance in addressing current cyber security challenges and shaping future automation mitigation approaches.",2025-09-15 08:09:23+00:00,2025-09-15 08:09:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11668v1
Inducing Uncertainty on Open-Weight Models for Test-Time Privacy in Image Recognition,"A key concern for AI safety remains understudied in the machine learning (ML) literature: how can we ensure users of ML models do not leverage predictions on incorrect personal data to harm others? This is particularly pertinent given the rise of open-weight models, where simply masking model outputs does not suffice to prevent adversaries from recovering harmful predictions. To address this threat, which we call *test-time privacy*, we induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on all other instances. Our proposed algorithm uses a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, δ)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains at least $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with marginal drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.",2025-09-29 21:48:46+00:00,2025-09-15 06:38:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11625v2
Cyber Threat Hunting: Non-Parametric Mining of Attack Patterns from Cyber Threat Intelligence for Precise Threats Attribution,"With the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats, identifying their origin has become paramount, surpassing the simple task of attack classification. Cyber threat attribution gives security analysts the insights they need to device effective threat mitigation strategies. Such strategies empower enterprises to proactively detect and defend against future cyber-attacks. However, existing approaches exhibit limitations in accurately identifying threat actors, leading to low precision and a significant occurrence of false positives. Machine learning offers the potential to automate certain aspects of cyber threat attribution. The distributed nature of information regarding cyber threat actors and their intricate attack methodologies has hindered substantial progress in this domain. Cybersecurity analysts deal with an ever-expanding collection of cyber threat intelligence documents. While these documents hold valuable insights, their sheer volume challenges efficient organization and retrieval of pertinent information. To assist the cybersecurity analyst activities, we propose a machine learning based approach featuring visually interactive analytics tool named the Cyber-Attack Pattern Explorer (CAPE), designed to facilitate efficient information discovery by employing interactive visualization and mining techniques. In the proposed system, a non-parametric mining technique is proposed to create a dataset for identifying the attack patterns within cyber threat intelligence documents. These attack patterns align semantically with commonly employed themes ensuring ease of interpretation. The extracted dataset is used for training of proposed machine learning algorithms that enables the attribution of cyber threats with respective to the actors.",2025-09-15 06:15:22+00:00,2025-09-15 06:15:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11615v1
AMLNet: A Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Generate and Detect Realistic Money Laundering Transactions,"Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.",2025-09-15 05:25:46+00:00,2025-09-15 05:25:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11595v1
MAUI: Reconstructing Private Client Data in Federated Transfer Learning,"Recent works in federated learning (FL) have shown the utility of leveraging transfer learning for balancing the benefits of FL and centralized learning. In this setting, federated training happens after a stable point has been reached through conventional training. Global model weights are first centrally pretrained by the server on a public dataset following which only the last few linear layers (the classification head) of the model are finetuned across clients. In this scenario, existing data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) in FL show two key weaknesses. First, strongly input-correlated gradient information from the initial model layers is never shared, significantly degrading reconstruction accuracy. Second, DRAs in which the server makes highly specific, handcrafted manipulations to the model structure or parameters (for e.g., layers with all zero weights, identity mappings and rows with identical weight patterns) are easily detectable by an active client.   Improving on these, we propose MAUI, a stealthy DRA that does not require any overt manipulations to the model architecture or weights, and relies solely on the gradients of the classification head. MAUI first extracts ""robust"" feature representations of the input batch from the gradients of the classification head and subsequently inverts these representations to the original inputs. We report highly accurate reconstructions on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets on a variety of model architectures including convolution networks (CNN, VGG11), ResNets (18, 50), ShuffleNet-V2 and Vision Transformer (ViT B-32), regardless of the batch size. MAUI significantly outperforms prior DRAs in reconstruction quality, achieving 40-120% higher PSNR scores.",2025-09-14 21:52:47+00:00,2025-09-14 21:52:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11451v1
Thunderhammer: Rowhammer Bitflips via PCIe and Thunderbolt (USB-C),"In recent years, Rowhammer has attracted significant attention from academia and industry alike. This technique, first published in 2014, flips bits in memory by repeatedly accessing neighbouring memory locations. Since its discovery, researchers have developed a substantial body of work exploiting Rowhammer and proposing countermeasures. These works demonstrate that Rowhammer can be mounted not only through native code, but also via remote code execution, such as JavaScript in browsers, and over networks.   In this work, we uncover a previously unexplored Rowhammer vector. We present Thunderhammer, an attack that induces DRAM bitflips from malicious peripherals connected via PCIe or Thunderbolt (which tunnels PCIe). On modern DDR4 systems, we observe that triggering bitflips through PCIe requests requires precisely timed access patterns tailored to the target system. We design a custom device to reverse engineer critical architectural parameters that shape PCIe request scheduling, and to execute effective hammering access patterns. Leveraging this knowledge, we successfully demonstrate Rowhammer-induced bitflips in DDR4 memory modules via both PCIe slot connections and Thunderbolt ports tunnelling PCIe.",2025-09-17 07:56:08+00:00,2025-09-14 21:24:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11440v2
Pulse-to-Circuit Characterization of Stealthy Crosstalk Attack on Multi-Tenant Superconducting Quantum Hardware,"Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers constitutes a significant security threat, enabling adversaries to inject targeted errors across tenant boundaries. We present the first end-to-end framework for mapping physical pulse-level attacks to interpretable logical error channels, integrating density-matrix simulation, quantum process tomography (QPT), and a novel isometry-based circuit extraction method. Our pipeline reconstructs the complete induced error channel and fits an effective logical circuit model, revealing a fundamentally asymmetric attack mechanism: one adversarial qubit acts as a driver to set the induced logical rotation, while a second, the catalyst, refines the attack's coherence. Demonstrated on a linear three-qubit system, our approach shows that such attacks can significantly disrupt diverse quantum protocols, sometimes reducing accuracy to random guessing, while remaining effective and stealthy even under realistic hardware parameter variations. We further propose a protocol-level detection strategy based on observable attack signatures, showing that stealthy attacks can be exposed through targeted monitoring and providing a foundation for future defense-in-depth in quantum cloud platforms.",2025-09-14 19:48:46+00:00,2025-09-14 19:48:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11407v1
DMLDroid: Deep Multimodal Fusion Framework for Android Malware Detection with Resilience to Code Obfuscation and Adversarial Perturbations,"In recent years, learning-based Android malware detection has seen significant advancements, with detectors generally falling into three categories: string-based, image-based, and graph-based approaches. While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.",2025-09-14 09:32:27+00:00,2025-09-14 09:32:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11187v1
A Biosecurity Agent for Lifecycle LLM Biosecurity Alignment,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis. In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three sanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety terms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to 70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment (Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions, reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference (Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability trade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall = 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together, our biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that reduces attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards for the use of LLMs in scientific research and setting a precedent for future agent-level security protections.",2025-09-13 23:54:54+00:00,2025-09-13 23:54:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09615v1
A Range-Based Sharding (RBS) Protocol for Scalable Enterprise Blockchain,"Blockchain technology offers decentralization and security but struggles with scalability, particularly in enterprise settings where efficiency and controlled access are paramount. Sharding is a promising solution for private blockchains, yet existing approaches face challenges in coordinating shards, ensuring fault tolerance with limited nodes, and minimizing the high overhead of consensus mechanisms like PBFT. This paper proposes the Range-Based Sharding (RBS) Protocol, a novel sharding mechanism tailored for enterprise blockchains, implemented on Quorum. Unlike traditional sharding models such as OmniLedger and non-sharding Corda framework, RBS employs a commit-reveal scheme for secure and unbiased shard allocation, ensuring fair validator distribution while reducing cross-shard transaction delays. Our approach enhances scalability by balancing computational loads across shards, reducing consensus overhead, and improving parallel transaction execution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RBS achieves significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing enterprise sharding frameworks, making it a viable and efficient solution for largescale blockchain deployments.",2025-09-13 23:09:38+00:00,2025-09-13 23:09:38+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11006v1
Finding SSH Strict Key Exchange Violations by State Learning,"SSH is an important protocol for secure remote shell access to servers on the Internet. At USENIX 2024, Bäumer et al. presented the Terrapin attack on SSH, which relies on the attacker injecting optional messages during the key exchange. To mitigate this attack, SSH vendors adopted an extension developed by OpenSSH called strict key exchange (""strict KEX""). With strict KEX, optional messages are forbidden during the handshake, preventing the attack. In practice, this should simplify the state machine of an SSH handshake to a linear message flow similar to that of TLS.   In this work, we analyze the design, implementation, and security of strict KEX in popular SSH servers, using black-box state learning, which can uncover the hidden state machine of an implementation. In practice, it is limited by the number of learned messages and the complexity of the state machine. Thus, learning the complete state machine of SSH is infeasible. Previous research on SSH, therefore, excluded optional messages, learning only a partial state machine. However, these messages are a critical part of the Terrapin attack. We propose to instead learn the complete state machine of the handshake phase of an SSH server, but with strict KEX enabled.   We investigate the security of ten SSH implementations supporting strict KEX for up to five key exchange algorithms. In total, we learn 33 state machines, revealing significant differences in the implementations. We show that seven implementations violate the strict KEX specification and find two critical security vulnerabilities. One results in a rogue session attack in the proprietary Tectia SSH implementation. Another affects the official SSH implementation of the Erlang Open Telecom Platform, and enables unauthenticated remote code execution in the security context of the SSH server.",2025-09-13 16:54:10+00:00,2025-09-13 16:54:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10895v1
A Comparison of Selected Image Transformation Techniques for Malware Classification,"Recently, a considerable amount of malware research has focused on the use of powerful image-based machine learning techniques, which generally yield impressive results. However, before image-based techniques can be applied to malware, the samples must be converted to images, and there is no generally-accepted approach for doing so. The malware-to-image conversion strategies found in the literature often appear to be ad hoc, with little or no effort made to take into account properties of executable files. In this paper, we experiment with eight distinct malware-to-image conversion techniques, and for each, we test a variety of learning models. We find that several of these image conversion techniques perform similarly across a range of learning models, in spite of the image conversion processes being quite different. These results suggest that the effectiveness of image-based malware classification techniques may depend more on the inherent strengths of image analysis techniques, as opposed to the precise details of the image conversion strategy.",2025-09-13 15:00:10+00:00,2025-09-13 15:00:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10838v1
From Paradigm Shift to Audit Rift: Exploring Vulnerabilities and Audit Tips for TON Smart Contracts,"The Open Network (TON) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for scalability and efficiency, leveraging an asynchronous execution model and a multi-layered architecture. While TON's design offers significant advantages, it also introduces unique challenges for smart contract development and security. This paper introduces a comprehensive audit checklist for TON smart contracts, based on an analysis of 34 professional audit reports containing 233 real-world vulnerabilities. The checklist addresses TON-specific challenges, such as asynchronous message handling, and provides actionable insights for developers and auditors. We also present detailed case studies of vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts, highlighting their implications and offering lessons learned. By adopting this checklist, developers and auditors can systematically identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, enhancing the security and reliability of TON-based projects. Our work bridges the gap between Ethereum's mature audit methodologies and the emerging needs of the TON ecosystem, fostering a more secure and robust blockchain environment.",2025-09-13 14:41:03+00:00,2025-09-13 14:41:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10823v1
ORQ: Complex Analytics on Private Data with Strong Security Guarantees,"We present ORQ, a system that enables collaborative analysis of large private datasets using cryptographically secure multi-party computation (MPC). ORQ protects data against semi-honest or malicious parties and can efficiently evaluate relational queries with multi-way joins and aggregations that have been considered notoriously expensive under MPC. To do so, ORQ eliminates the quadratic cost of secure joins by leveraging the fact that, in practice, the structure of many real queries allows us to join records and apply the aggregations ""on the fly"" while keeping the result size bounded. On the system side, ORQ contributes generic oblivious operators, a data-parallel vectorized query engine, a communication layer that amortizes MPC network costs, and a dataflow API for expressing relational analytics -- all built from the ground up.   We evaluate ORQ in LAN and WAN deployments on a diverse set of workloads, including complex queries with multiple joins and custom aggregations. When compared to state-of-the-art solutions, ORQ significantly reduces MPC execution times and can process one order of magnitude larger datasets. For our most challenging workload, the full TPC-H benchmark, we report results entirely under MPC with Scale Factor 10 -- a scale that had previously been achieved only with information leakage or the use of trusted third parties.",2025-09-13 03:19:01+00:00,2025-09-13 03:19:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10793v1
"Security theory for data flow and access control: From partial orders to lattices and back, a half-century trip","The multi level Bell La Padula model for secure data access and data flow control, formulated in the 1970s, was based on the theory of partial orders. Since then, another model, based on lattice theory, has prevailed. We present reasons why the partial order model is more appropriate. We also show, by example, how non lattice data flow networks can be easily implemented by using Attribute-based access control (ABAC).",2025-09-12 22:33:06+00:00,2025-09-12 22:33:06+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10727v1
Feature-Centric Approaches to Android Malware Analysis: A Survey,"Sophisticated malware families exploit the openness of the Android platform to infiltrate IoT networks, enabling large-scale disruption, data exfiltration, and denial-of-service attacks. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines cutting-edge approaches to Android malware analysis with direct implications for securing IoT infrastructures. We analyze feature extraction techniques across static, dynamic, hybrid, and graph-based methods, highlighting their trade-offs: static analysis offers efficiency but is easily evaded through obfuscation; dynamic analysis provides stronger resistance to evasive behaviors but incurs high computational costs, often unsuitable for lightweight IoT devices; hybrid approaches balance accuracy with resource considerations; and graph-based methods deliver superior semantic modeling and adversarial robustness. This survey contributes a structured comparison of existing methods, exposes research gaps, and outlines a roadmap for future directions to enhance scalability, adaptability, and long-term security in IoT-driven Android malware detection.",2025-09-12 21:55:26+00:00,2025-09-12 21:55:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10709v1
Accurate and Private Diagnosis of Rare Genetic Syndromes from Facial Images with Federated Deep Learning,"Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.",2025-09-12 18:42:33+00:00,2025-09-12 18:42:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10635v1
Bitcoin Cross-Chain Bridge: A Taxonomy and Its Promise in Artificial Intelligence of Things,"Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities and lack of native interoperability mechanisms have constrained its integration into the broader blockchain ecosystem, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) and multi-chain applications. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Bitcoin cross-chain bridge protocols, systematically analyzing their trust assumptions, performance characteristics, and applicability to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. We categorize bridge designs into three main types: naive token swapping, pegged-asset bridges, and arbitrary-message bridges. Each category is evaluated across key metrics such as trust model, latency, capital efficiency, and DeFi composability. Emerging innovations like BitVM and recursive sidechains are highlighted for their potential to enable secure, scalable, and programmable Bitcoin interoperability. Furthermore, we explore practical use cases of cross-chain bridges in AIoT applications, including decentralized energy trading, healthcare data integration, and supply chain automation. This taxonomy provides a foundational framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to design secure and efficient cross-chain infrastructures in AIoT systems.",2025-11-02 06:58:59+00:00,2025-09-12 17:10:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10413v2

In this perspective paper, we introduce a structured, multi-phased framework, ""SME-TEAM"" for the secure and responsible use of these technologies in SMEs. Based on a conceptual structure of four key pillars, i.e., Data, Algorithms, Human Oversight, and Model Architecture, SME-TEAM bridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI capabilities across a wide range of applications in SMEs. Ultimately, this paper provides a structured roadmap for the adoption of these emerging technologies, positioning trust and ethics as a driving force for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation within the area of business analytics and SMEs.",2025-11-05 16:07:58+00:00,2025-09-12 14:59:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10594v2
Innovating Augmented Reality Security: Recent E2E Encryption Approaches,"End-to-end encryption (E2EE) has emerged as a fundamental element of modern digital communication, protecting data from unauthorized access during transmission. By design, E2EE ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the information, making it inaccessible even to service providers. Yet, this powerful safeguard of individual privacy and digital trust also introduces a paradox: it can simultaneously prevent law enforcement efforts by hiding potential malicious activities. This paper examines the dual role of E2EE, its critical importance to privacy, the challenges it",2025-09-12 14:56:05+00:00,2025-09-12 14:56:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10313v1
Dynamic Vulnerability Patching for Heterogeneous Embedded Systems Using Stack Frame Reconstruction,"Existing dynamic vulnerability patching techniques are not well-suited for embedded devices, especially mission-critical ones such as medical equipment, as they have limited computational power and memory but uninterrupted service requirements. Those devices often lack sufficient idle memory for dynamic patching, and the diverse architectures of embedded systems further complicate the creation of patch triggers that are compatible across various system kernels and hardware platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a hot patching framework called StackPatch that facilitates patch development based on stack frame reconstruction. StackPatch introduces different triggering strategies to update programs stored in memory units. We leverage the exception-handling mechanisms commonly available in embedded processors to enhance StackPatch's adaptability across different processor architectures for control flow redirection. We evaluated StackPatch on embedded devices featuring three major microcontroller (MCU) architectures: ARM, RISC-V, and Xtensa. In the experiments, we used StackPatch to successfully fix 102 publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in real-time operating systems (RTOS). We applied patching to medical devices, soft programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and network services, with StackPatch consistently completing each vulnerability remediation in less than 260 MCU clock cycles.",2025-09-12 13:00:45+00:00,2025-09-12 13:00:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10213v1
Why Data Anonymization Has Not Taken Off,"Companies are looking to data anonymization research $\unicode{x2013}$ including differential private and synthetic data methods $\unicode{x2013}$ for simple and straightforward compliance solutions. But data anonymization has not taken off in practice because it is anything but simple to implement. For one, it requires making complex choices which are case dependent, such as the domain of the dataset to anonymize; the units to protect; the scope where the data protection should extend to; and the standard of protection. Each variation of these choices changes the very meaning, as well as the practical implications, of differential privacy (or of any other measure of data anonymization). Yet differential privacy is frequently being branded as the same privacy guarantee regardless of variations in these choices. Some data anonymization methods can be effective, but only when the insights required are much larger than the unit of protection. Given that businesses care about profitability, any solution must preserve the patterns between a firm's data and that profitability. As a result, data anonymization solutions usually need to be bespoke and case-specific, which reduces their scalability. Companies should not expect easy wins, but rather recognize that anonymization is just one approach to data privacy with its own particular advantages and drawbacks, while the best strategies jointly leverage the full range of approaches to data privacy and security in combination.",2025-09-20 11:44:07+00:00,2025-09-12 11:45:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10165v2
rCamInspector: Building Reliability and Trust on IoT (Spy) Camera Detection using XAI,"The classification of network traffic using machine learning (ML) models is one of the primary mechanisms to address the security issues in IoT networks and/or IoT devices. However, the ML models often act as black-boxes that create a roadblock to take critical decision based on the model output. To address this problem, we design and develop a system, called rCamInspector, that employs Explainable AI (XAI) to provide reliable and trustworthy explanations to model output. rCamInspector adopts two classifiers, Flow Classifier - categorizes a flow into one of four classes, IoTCam, Conf, Share and Others, and SmartCam Classifier - classifies an IoTCam flow into one of six classes, Netatmo, Spy Clock, Canary, D3D, Ezviz, V380 Spy Bulb; both are IP address and transport port agnostic. rCamInspector is evaluated using 38GB of network traffic and our results show that XGB achieves the highest accuracy of 92% and 99% in the Flow and SmartCam classifiers respectively among eight supervised ML models. We analytically show that the traditional mutual information (MI) based feature importance cannot provide enough reliability on the model output of XGB in either classifiers. Using SHAP and LIME, we show that a separate set of features can be picked up to explain a correct prediction of XGB. For example, the feature Init Bwd Win Byts turns out to have the highest SHAP values to support the correct prediction of both IoTCam in Flow Classifier and Netatmo class in SmartCam Classifier. To evaluate the faithfulness of the explainers on our dataset, we show that both SHAP and LIME have a consistency of more than 0.7 and a sufficiency of 1.0. Comparing with existing works, we show that rCamInspector achieves a better accuracy (99%), precision (99%), and false negative rate (0.7%).",2025-09-12 06:13:49+00:00,2025-09-12 06:13:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09989v1
Byte by Byte: Unmasking Browser Fingerprinting at the Function Level Using V8 Bytecode Transformers,"Browser fingerprinting enables persistent cross-site user tracking via subtle techniques that often evade conventional defenses or cause website breakage when script-level blocking countermeasures are applied. Addressing these challenges requires detection methods offering both function-level precision to minimize breakage and inherent robustness against code obfuscation and URL manipulation.   We introduce ByteDefender, the first system leveraging V8 engine bytecode to detect fingerprinting operations specifically at the JavaScript function level. A Transformer-based classifier, trained offline on bytecode sequences, accurately identifies functions exhibiting fingerprinting behavior. We develop and evaluate light-weight signatures derived from this model to enable low-overhead, on-device matching against function bytecode during compilation but prior to execution, which only adds a 4% (average) latency to the page load time. This mechanism facilitates targeted, real-time prevention of fingerprinting function execution, thereby preserving legitimate script functionality. Operating directly on bytecode ensures inherent resilience against common code obfuscation and URL-based evasion. Our evaluation on the top 100k websites demonstrates high detection accuracy at both function- and script-level, with substantial improvements over state-of-the-art AST-based methods, particularly in robustness against obfuscation. ByteDefender offers a practical framework for effective, precise, and robust fingerprinting mitigation.",2025-09-12 03:58:01+00:00,2025-09-12 03:58:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09950v1
Towards Secure and Explainable Smart Contract Generation with Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization,"Smart contracts automate the management of high-value assets, where vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic financial losses. This challenge is amplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they operate as unauditable ""black boxes"" lacking a transparent reasoning process, and consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities. To address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a novel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated reasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security analysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement learning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted reward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format correctness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world functions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top performance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a SafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This FullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline, DeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human evaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security (85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%).",2025-10-12 04:04:06+00:00,2025-09-12 03:14:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09942v2
"When Your Reviewer is an LLM: Biases, Divergence, and Prompt Injection Risks in Peer Review","Peer review is the cornerstone of academic publishing, yet the process is increasingly strained by rising submission volumes, reviewer overload, and expertise mismatches. Large language models (LLMs) are now being used as ""reviewer aids,"" raising concerns about their fairness, consistency, and robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs as academic reviewers. Using a curated dataset of 1,441 papers from ICLR 2023 and NeurIPS 2022, we evaluate GPT-5-mini against human reviewers across ratings, strengths, and weaknesses. The evaluation employs structured prompting with reference paper calibration, topic modeling, and similarity analysis to compare review content. We further embed covert instructions into PDF submissions to assess LLMs' susceptibility to prompt injection. Our findings show that LLMs consistently inflate ratings for weaker papers while aligning more closely with human judgments on stronger contributions. Moreover, while overarching malicious prompts induce only minor shifts in topical focus, explicitly field-specific instructions successfully manipulate specific aspects of LLM-generated reviews. This study underscores both the promises and perils of integrating LLMs into peer review and points to the importance of designing safeguards that ensure integrity and trust in future review processes.",2025-09-12 00:57:50+00:00,2025-09-12 00:57:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09912v1
NISQ Security and Complexity via Simple Classical Reasoning,"We give novel lifting theorems for security games in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings such as the hybrid query model, the noisy oracle and the bounded-depth models. We provide, for the first time, a hybrid lifting theorem for hybrid algorithms that can perform both quantum and classical queries, as well as a lifting theorem for quantum algorithms with access to noisy oracles or bounded quantum depth.   At the core of our results lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework, called hybrid coherent measure-and-reprogramming, tailored specifically for hybrid algorithms. Equipped with the lifting theorem, we are able to prove directly NISQ security and complexity results by calculating a single combinatorial quantity, relying solely on classical reasoning.   As applications, we derive the first direct product theorems in the average case, in the hybrid setting-i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hybrid hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the NISQ hardness of various security games, such as (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other games.",2025-09-11 23:31:39+00:00,2025-09-11 23:31:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09900v1
Improved Quantum Lifting by Coherent Measure-and-Reprogram,"We give a tighter lifting theorem for security games in the quantum random oracle model. At the core of our main result lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework that we call coherent reprogramming. This framework gives a tighter lifting theorem for query complexity problems, that only requires purely classical reasoning. As direct applications of our lifting theorem, we first provide a quantum direct product theorem in the average case - i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hardness of solving multi-instance security games.

Ordered Consensus with Equal Opportunity,"The specification of state machine replication (SMR) has no requirement on the final total order of commands. In blockchains based on SMR, however, order matters, since different orders could provide their clients with different financial rewards. Ordered consensus augments the specification of SMR to include specific guarantees on such order, with a focus on limiting the influence of Byzantine nodes. Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can and do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors, such as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure, that give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this paper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support equal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social sciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who, according to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for a position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have an equal chance of landing it. We show how randomness can be leveraged to keep bias in check, and, to this end, introduce the secret random oracle (SRO), a system component that generates randomness in a fault-tolerant manner. We describe two SRO designs based, respectively, on trusted hardware and threshold verifiable random functions, and instantiate them in Bercow, a new ordered consensus protocol that, by approximating equal opportunity up to within a configurable factor, can effectively mitigate well-known ordering attacks in SMR-based blockchains.",2025-09-11 21:43:13+00:00,2025-09-11 21:43:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09868v1
Multi-channel secure communication framework for wireless IoT (MCSC-WoT): enhancing security in Internet of Things,"In modern smart systems, the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless of Things (WoT) have been revolutionized by offering a broad level of wireless connectivity and communication among various devices. Hitherto, this greater interconnectivity poses important security problems, including the question of how to securely interconnect different networks, preserve secure communication channels, and maintain data integrity. However, the traditional cryptographic method and frequency hopping technique, although they provide some protection, are not sufficient to defend against Man-In-The-Middle, jamming, and replay attacks. In addition, synchronization issues in multi-channel communication systems result in increased latency and energy consumption, which make them unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT and WoT devices. This work presents the Multi-Channel Secure Communication (MCSC) framework, which integrates advanced cryptographic protocols with dynamic channel-hopping strategies to enhance security with reduced synchronization overhead. The MCSC framework maximizes the critical performance metrics, such as packet delivery ratio, latency, throughput, and energy efficiency, and fulfills the specific requirements of the IoT and WoT networks. A comprehensive comparison of MCSC with well-established methods, including Frequency Hop Spread Spectrum, single channel Advanced Encryption Standard, and various Elliptic Curve Cryptography-based schemes, indicates that MCSC has lower error rates and is more resilient to a wider range of cyber attacks. The efficiency of the proposed solution to secure IoT and WoT networks without compromising the operational performance is validated under various interference conditions.",2025-09-11 20:59:13+00:00,2025-09-11 20:59:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10581v1
ZORRO: Zero-Knowledge Robustness and Privacy for Split Learning (Full Version),"Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning approach that enables resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train deep neural networks (DNNs) by offloading most layers to a central server while keeping in- and output layers on the client-side. This setup enables SL to leverage server computation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in resource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the distributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training process. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors into the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on server-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A significant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients to correctly execute the defense algorithm.   We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme. Through our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense algorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the benign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency representation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth inspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring that each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our extensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various attack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it reduces the attack success rate to less than 6\% while causing even for models storing \numprint{1000000} parameters on the client-side an overhead of less than 10 seconds.",2025-09-11 18:44:09+00:00,2025-09-11 18:44:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09787v1

"[Extended] Ethics in Computer Security Research: A Data-Driven Assessment of the Past, the Present, and the Possible Future","Ethical questions are discussed regularly in computer security. Still, researchers in computer security lack clear guidance on how to make, document, and assess ethical decisions in research when what is morally right or acceptable is not clear-cut. In this work, we give an overview of the discussion of ethical implications in current published work in computer security by reviewing all 1154 top-tier security papers published in 2024, finding inconsistent levels of ethics reporting with a strong focus of reporting institutional or ethics board approval, human subjects protection, and responsible disclosure, and a lack of discussion of balancing harms and benefits. We further report on the results of a semi-structured interview study with 24 computer security and privacy researchers (among whom were also: reviewers, ethics committee members, and/or program chairs) and their ethical decision-making both as authors and during peer review, finding a strong desire for ethical research, but a lack of consistency in considered values, ethical frameworks (if articulated), decision-making, and outcomes.

On the Security of SSH Client Signatures,"Administrators and developers use SSH client keys and signatures for authentication, for example, to access internet backbone servers or to commit new code on platforms like GitHub. However, unlike servers, SSH clients cannot be measured through internet scans. We close this gap in two steps. First, we collect SSH client public keys. Such keys are regularly published by their owners on open development platforms like GitHub and GitLab. We systematize previous non-academic work by subjecting these keys to various security tests in a longitudinal study. Second, in a series of black-box lab experiments, we analyze the implementations of algorithms for SSH client signatures in 24 popular SSH clients for Linux, Windows, and macOS.   We extracted 31,622,338 keys from three public sources in two scans. Compared to previous work, we see a clear tendency to abandon RSA signatures in favor of EdDSA signatures. Still, in January 2025, we found 98 broken short keys, 139 keys generated from weak randomness, and 149 keys with common or small factors-the large majority of the retrieved keys exposed no weakness.   Weak randomness can not only compromise a secret key through its public key, but also through signatures. It is well-known that a bias in random nonces in ECDSA can reveal the secret key through public signatures. For the first time, we show that the use of deterministic nonces in ECDSA can also be dangerous: The private signing key of a PuTTY client can be recovered from just 58 valid signatures if ECDSA with NIST curve P-521 is used. PuTTY acknowledged our finding in CVE-2024-31497, and they subsequently replaced the nonce generation algorithm.",2025-09-11 10:32:13+00:00,2025-09-11 10:32:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09331v1
ORCA: Unveiling Obscure Containers In The Wild,"Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.",2025-09-11 10:12:56+00:00,2025-09-11 10:12:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09322v1
What You Code Is What We Prove: Translating BLE App Logic into Formal Models with LLMs for Vulnerability Detection,"The application layer of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a growing source of security vulnerabilities, as developers often neglect to implement critical protections such as encryption, authentication, and freshness. While formal verification offers a principled way to check these properties, the manual effort of constructing formal models makes it impractical for large-scale analysis. This paper introduces a key insight: BLE application security analysis can be reframed as a semantic translation problem, i.e., from real-world code to formal models. We leverage large language models (LLMs) not to directly detect vulnerabilities, but to serve as translators that convert BLE-specific code into process models verifiable by tools like ProVerif. We implement this idea in VerifiaBLE, a system that combines static analysis, prompt-guided LLM translation, and symbolic verification to check three core security features: encryption, randomness, and authentication. Applied to 1,050 Android BLE apps, VerifiaBLE uncovers systemic weaknesses: only 10.2\% of apps implement all three protections, while 53.9\% omit them entirely. Our work demonstrates that using LLMs as structured translators can lower the barrier to formal methods, unlocking scalable verification across security-critical domains.",2025-09-11 09:27:37+00:00,2025-09-11 09:27:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09291v1
MarkDiffusion: An Open-Source Toolkit for Generative Watermarking of Latent Diffusion Models,"We introduce MarkDiffusion, an open-source Python toolkit for generative watermarking of latent diffusion models. It comprises three key components: a unified implementation framework for streamlined watermarking algorithm integrations and user-friendly interfaces; a mechanism visualization suite that intuitively showcases added and extracted watermark patterns to aid public understanding; and a comprehensive evaluation module offering standard implementations of 24 tools across three essential aspects - detectability, robustness, and output quality - plus 8 automated evaluation pipelines. Through MarkDiffusion, we seek to assist researchers, enhance public awareness and engagement in generative watermarking, and promote consensus while advancing research and applications.",2025-10-16 07:42:56+00:00,2025-09-11 07:57:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10569v2
IoTFuzzSentry: A Protocol Guided Mutation Based Fuzzer for Automatic Vulnerability Testing in Commercial IoT Devices,"Protocol fuzzing is a scalable and cost-effective technique for identifying security vulnerabilities in deployed Internet of Things devices. During their operational phase, IoT devices often run lightweight servers to handle user interactions, such as video streaming or image capture in smart cameras. Implementation flaws in transport or application-layer security mechanisms can expose IoT devices to a range of threats, including unauthorized access and data leakage. This paper addresses the challenge of uncovering such vulnerabilities by leveraging protocol fuzzing techniques that inject crafted transport and application-layer packets into IoT communications. We present a mutation-based fuzzing tool, named IoTFuzzSentry, to identify specific non-trivial vulnerabilities in commercial IoT devices. We further demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios. We integrated our fuzzing tool into a well-known testing tool Cotopaxi and evaluated it with commercial-off-the-shelf IoT devices such as IP cameras and Smart Plug. Our evaluation revealed vulnerabilities categorized into 4 types (IoT Access Credential Leakage, Sneak IoT Live Video Stream, Creep IoT Live Image, IoT Command Injection) and we show their exploits using three IoT devices. We have responsibly disclosed all these vulnerabilities to the respective vendors. So far, we have published two CVEs, CVE-2024-41623 and CVE-2024-42531, and one is awaiting. To extend the applicability, we have investigated the traffic of six additional IoT devices and our analysis shows that these devices can have similar vulnerabilities, due to the presence of a similar set of application protocols. We believe that IoTFuzzSentry has the potential to discover unconventional security threats and allow IoT vendors to strengthen the security of their commercialized IoT devices automatically with negligible overhead.",2025-09-11 05:40:18+00:00,2025-09-11 05:40:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09158v1
SG-ML: Smart Grid Cyber Range Modelling Language,"This work provides a detailed specification of the Smart Grid Modelling Language (SG-ML), which is designed for the automated generation of smart grid cyber ranges. SG-ML is defined as a set of XML schemas that describe a smart grid's configuration in both machine-readable and human-friendly ways, thereby bridging the gap between system modelling and automated deployment. Unlike prior ad-hoc approaches to cyber range design, SG-ML provides a unified methodology that integrates both power system and cyber network representations. The SG-ML model can be customized by users to meet specific requirements, such as emulating physical or cyber topologies and configuring network devices. An SG-ML Processor then parses this configured model to instantiate the cyber range environment. The modelling language leverages established standards like the IEC 61850 Substation Configuration Language (SCL) and IEC 61131 PLCopen XML to define power system topology, cyber network topology, and device configurations. This approach allows for the reuse of existing assets, reducing the effort needed to create the SG-ML model. To address gaps not covered by these standards such as attack injection parameters, scenario-specific metadata, and additional network constraints, SG-ML introduces proprietary schemas that complement standard models. Overall, SG-ML enables reproducible, scalable, and automated generation of realistic smart grid cyber ranges for research, training, and security assessment.",2025-09-11 04:49:09+00:00,2025-09-11 04:49:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10568v1
Character-Level Perturbations Disrupt LLM Watermarks,"Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.   To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.",2025-09-14 07:46:04+00:00,2025-09-11 02:50:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09112v2
CryptGNN: Enabling Secure Inference for Graph Neural Networks,"We present CryptGNN, a secure and effective inference solution for third-party graph neural network (GNN) models in the cloud, which are accessed by clients as ML as a service (MLaaS). The main novelty of CryptGNN is its secure message passing and feature transformation layers using distributed secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques. CryptGNN protects the client's input data and graph structure from the cloud provider and the third-party model owner, and it protects the model parameters from the cloud provider and the clients. CryptGNN works with any number of SMPC parties, does not require a trusted server, and is provably secure even if P-1 out of P parties in the cloud collude. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments demonstrate the security and efficiency of CryptGNN.",2025-09-11 02:35:33+00:00,2025-09-11 02:35:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09107v1
AgriSentinel: Privacy-Enhanced Embedded-LLM Crop Disease Alerting System,"Crop diseases pose significant threats to global food security, agricultural productivity, and sustainable farming practices, directly affecting farmers' livelihoods and economic stability. To address the growing need for effective crop disease management, AI-based disease alerting systems have emerged as promising tools by providing early detection and actionable insights for timely intervention. However, existing systems often overlook critical aspects such as data privacy, market pricing power, and farmer-friendly usability, leaving farmers vulnerable to privacy breaches and economic exploitation. To bridge these gaps, we propose AgriSentinel, the first Privacy-Enhanced Embedded-LLM Crop Disease Alerting System. AgriSentinel incorporates a differential privacy mechanism to protect sensitive crop image data while maintaining classification accuracy. Its lightweight deep learning-based crop disease classification model is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and usability for farmers. Additionally, the system includes a fine-tuned, on-device large language model (LLM) that leverages a curated knowledge pool to provide farmers with specific, actionable suggestions for managing crop diseases, going beyond simple alerting. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AgriSentinel, demonstrating its ability to safeguard data privacy, maintain high classification performance, and deliver practical, actionable disease management strategies. AgriSentinel offers a robust, farmer-friendly solution for automating crop disease alerting and management, ultimately contributing to improved agricultural decision-making and enhanced crop productivity.",2025-09-11 02:29:19+00:00,2025-09-11 02:29:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09103v1
DP-FedLoRA: Privacy-Enhanced Federated Fine-Tuning for On-Device Large Language Models,"As on-device large language model (LLM) systems become increasingly prevalent, federated fine-tuning enables advanced language understanding and generation directly on edge devices; however, it also involves processing sensitive, user-specific data, raising significant privacy concerns within the federated learning framework. To address these challenges, we propose DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using Gaussian noise to satisfy ($ε$, $δ$)-differential privacy. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.",2025-09-11 02:16:34+00:00,2025-09-11 02:16:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09097v1
Towards Confidential and Efficient LLM Inference with Dual Privacy Protection,"CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP) have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while preserving user data privacy.",2025-09-11 01:54:13+00:00,2025-09-11 01:54:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09091v1
Fingerprinting Deep Packet Inspection Devices by Their Ambiguities,"Users around the world face escalating network interference such as censorship, throttling, and interception, largely driven by the commoditization and growing availability of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices. Once reserved for a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with traffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite this proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the Internet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive to conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring their products further complicates measurement efforts.   In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper), that derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster these otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward active reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing and interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves ambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC interpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices that create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP systematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that translate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable fingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its practical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative probes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including major nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products. We discuss how our fingerprinting methodology generalizes beyond censorship to other forms of targeted interference.",2025-09-11 01:08:37+00:00,2025-09-11 01:08:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09081v1
When FinTech Meets Privacy: Securing Financial LLMs with Differential Private Fine-Tuning,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into financial technology (FinTech) has revolutionized the analysis and processing of complex financial data, driving advancements in real-time decision-making and analytics. With the growing trend of deploying AI models on edge devices for financial applications, ensuring the privacy of sensitive financial data has become a significant challenge. To address this, we propose DPFinLLM, a privacy-enhanced, lightweight LLM specifically designed for on-device financial applications. DPFinLLM combines a robust differential privacy mechanism with a streamlined architecture inspired by state-of-the-art models, enabling secure and efficient processing of financial data. This proposed DPFinLLM can not only safeguard user data from privacy breaches but also ensure high performance across diverse financial tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple financial sentiment datasets validate the effectiveness of DPFinLLM, demonstrating its ability to achieve performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, even under strict privacy constraints.",2025-09-10 20:43:08+00:00,2025-09-10 20:43:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08995v1
Cross-Service Token: Finding Attacks in 5G Core Networks,"5G marks a major departure from previous cellular architectures, by transitioning from a monolithic design of the core network to a Service-Based Architecture (SBA) where services are modularized as Network Functions (NFs) which communicate with each other via standard-defined HTTP-based APIs called Service-Based Interfaces (SBIs). These NFs are deployed in private and public cloud infrastructure, and an access control framework based on OAuth restricts how they communicate with each other and obtain access to resources. Given the increased vulnerabilities of clouds to insiders, it is important to study the security of the 5G Core services for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to use compromised NFs to obtain unauthorized access to resources.   We present FivGeeFuzz, a grammar-based fuzzing framework designed to uncover security flaws in 5G core SBIs. FivGeeFuzz automatically derives grammars from 3GPP API specifications to generate malformed, unexpected, or semantically inconsistent inputs, and it integrates automated bug detection with manual validation and root-cause analysis. We evaluate our approach on free5GC, the only open-source 5G core implementing Release 17-compliant SBIs with an access control mechanism. Using FivGeeFuzz, we discovered 8 previously unknown vulnerabilities in free5GC, leading to runtime crashes, improper error handling, and unauthorized access to resources, including a very severe attack we call Cross-Service Token Attack. All bugs were confirmed by the free5GC team, 7 have already been patched, and the remaining one has a patch under development.",2025-09-10 20:40:33+00:00,2025-09-10 20:40:33+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08992v1
Quantum Error Correction in Adversarial Regimes,"In adversarial settings, where attackers can deliberately and strategically corrupt quantum data, standard quantum error correction reaches its limits. It can only correct up to half the code distance and must output a unique answer. Quantum list decoding offers a promising alternative. By allowing the decoder to output a short list of possible errors, it becomes possible to tolerate far more errors, even under worst-case noise. But two fundamental questions remain: which quantum codes support list decoding, and can we design decoding schemes that are secure against efficient, computationally bounded adversaries? In this work, we answer both. To identify which codes are list-decodable, we provide a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Then, using tools from quantum cryptography, we build an unambiguous list decoding protocol based on pseudorandom unitaries. Our scheme is secure against any quantum polynomial-time adversary, even across multiple decoding attempts, in contrast to previous schemes. Our approach connects coding theory with complexity-based quantum cryptography, paving the way for secure quantum information processing in adversarial settings.",2025-09-10 19:08:56+00:00,2025-09-10 19:08:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08943v1
PAnDA: Rethinking Metric Differential Privacy Optimization at Scale with Anchor-Based Approximation,"Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) extends the local differential privacy (LDP) framework to metric spaces, enabling more nuanced privacy protection for data such as geo-locations. However, existing mDP optimization methods, particularly those based on linear programming (LP), face scalability challenges due to the quadratic growth in decision variables. In this paper, we propose Perturbation via Anchor-based Distributed Approximation (PAnDA), a scalable two-phase framework for optimizing metric differential privacy (mDP). To reduce computational overhead, PAnDA allows each user to select a small set of anchor records, enabling the server to solve a compact linear program over a reduced domain. We introduce three anchor selection strategies, exponential decay (PAnDA-e), power-law decay (PAnDA-p), and logistic decay (PAnDA-l), and establish theoretical guarantees under a relaxed privacy notion called probabilistic mDP (PmDP). Experiments on real-world geo-location datasets demonstrate that PAnDA scales to secret domains with up to 5,000 records, two times larger than prior LP-based methods, while providing theoretical guarantees for both privacy and utility.",2025-09-10 16:14:08+00:00,2025-09-10 16:14:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08720v1
Automating the RMF: Lessons from the FedRAMP 20x Pilot,"The U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) has long relied on extensive sets of controls and static documentation to assess cloud systems. However, this manual, point-in-time approach has struggled to keep pace with cloud-native development. FedRAMP 20x, a 2025 pilot program, reimagines the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): replacing traditional NIST 800-53 controls with Key Security Indicators (KSIs), using automated, machine-readable evidence, and emphasizing continuous reporting and authorization.   This case study presents a practitioner-led field report from an industry participant who led multiple FedRAMP 20x pilot submissions and engaged directly with the FedRAMP PMO, 3PAOs, and community working groups. It explores how KSIs, continuous evidence pipelines, and DevSecOps integration can streamline authorization and improve cyber risk management. The study shows FedRAMP 20x as a live testbed for implementing the RMF in a cloud-native, automation-first approach and shares actionable recommendations for risk professionals seeking to modernize compliance and support real-time, risk-informed decision-making.",2025-09-10 13:51:25+00:00,2025-09-10 13:51:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09613v1
Flow-Based Detection and Identification of Zero-Day IoT Cameras,"The majority of consumer IoT devices lack mechanisms for administrators to monitor and control them, hindering tailored security policies. A key challenge is identifying whether a new device, especially a streaming IoT camera, has joined the network. We present zCamInspector, a system for identifying known IoT cameras with supervised classifiers (zCamClassifier) and detecting zero-day cameras with one-class classifiers (zCamDetector). We analyzed ~40GB of traffic across three datasets: Set I (six commercial IoT cameras), Set II (five open-source IoT cameras, ~1.5GB), and Set III (four conferencing and two video-sharing applications as non-IoT traffic). From each, 62 flow-based features were extracted using CICFlowmeter. zCamInspector employs seven supervised models (ET, DT, RF, KNN, XGB, LKSVM, GNB) and four one-class models (OCSVM, SGDOCSVM, IF, DeepSVDD). Results show that XGB identifies IoT cameras with >99% accuracy and false negatives as low as 0.3%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For zero-day detection, accuracies reached 93.20% (OCSVM), 96.55% (SGDOCSVM), 78.65% (IF), and 92.16% (DeepSVDD). When all devices were treated as zero-day, DeepSVDD performed best with mean training/testing accuracies of 96.03%/74.51%. zCamInspector also achieved >95% accuracy for specific devices, such as Spy Clock cameras, demonstrating its robustness for identifying and detecting zero-day IoT cameras in diverse network environments.",2025-09-10 10:50:14+00:00,2025-09-10 10:50:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08485v1

AVEC introduces an adaptive budgeting algorithm that allocates per-query differential privacy parameters based on sensitivity, local confidence, and historical usage, and uses verifiable transformation with on-device integrity checks. We formalize guarantees using Rényi differential privacy with odometer-based accounting, and establish utility ceilings, delegation-leakage bounds, and impossibility results for deterministic gating and hash-only certification. Our evaluation is simulation-based by design to study mechanism behavior and accounting; we do not claim deployment readiness or task-level utility with live LLMs. The contribution is a conceptual architecture and theoretical foundation that chart a pathway for empirical follow-up on privately bootstrapping local LLMs.",2025-09-10 07:59:01+00:00,2025-09-10 07:59:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10561v1

"ImportSnare: Directed ""Code Manual"" Hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation","Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces new attack surfaces.   In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security alignment for code generation tasks.

A Non-Monotonic Relationship: An Empirical Analysis of Hybrid Quantum Classifiers for Unseen Ransomware Detection,"Detecting unseen ransomware is a critical cybersecurity challenge where classical machine learning often fails. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents a potential alternative, its application is hindered by the dimensionality gap between classical data and quantum hardware. This paper empirically investigates a hybrid framework using a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) interfaced with a high-dimensional dataset via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis reveals a dual challenge for practical QML. A significant information bottleneck was evident, as even the best performing 12-qubit VQC fell short of the classical baselines 97.7\% recall. Furthermore, a non-monotonic performance trend, where performance degraded when scaling from 4 to 8 qubits before improving at 12 qubits suggests a severe trainability issue. These findings highlight that unlocking QMLs potential requires co-developing more efficient data compression techniques and robust quantum optimization strategies.",2025-09-09 17:06:45+00:00,2025-09-09 17:06:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07924v1

Embedded Off-Switches for AI Compute,"To address the risks of increasingly capable AI systems, we introduce a hardware-level off-switch that embeds thousands of independent ""security blocks"" in each AI accelerator. This massively redundant architecture is designed to prevent unauthorized chip use, even against sophisticated physical attacks. Our main security block design uses public key cryptography to check the authenticity of authorization licenses, and randomly generated nonces to prevent replay attacks.

Security blocks can be built with standard circuit components, ensuring compatibility with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. With embedded security blocks, the next generation of AI accelerators could be more robustly defended against dangerous misuse.",2025-09-09 12:04:24+00:00,2025-09-09 12:04:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07637v1
FlexEmu: Towards Flexible MCU Peripheral Emulation (Extended Version),"Microcontroller units (MCUs) are widely used in embedded devices due to their low power consumption and cost-effectiveness. MCU firmware controls these devices and is vital to the security of embedded systems. However, performing dynamic security analyses for MCU firmware has remained challenging due to the lack of usable execution environments -- existing dynamic analyses cannot run on physical devices (e.g., insufficient computational resources), while building emulators is costly due to the massive amount of heterogeneous hardware, especially peripherals.   Our work is based on the insight that MCU peripherals can be modeled in a two-fold manner. At the structural level, peripherals have diverse implementations but we can use a limited set of primitives to abstract peripherals because their hardware implementations are based on common hardware concepts. At the semantic level, peripherals have diverse functionalities. However, we can use a single unified semantic model to describe the same kind of peripherals because they exhibit similar functionalities. Building on this, we propose FlexEmu, a flexible MCU peripheral emulation framework. Once semantic models are created, FlexEmu automatically extracts peripheral-specific details to instantiate models and generate emulators accordingly. We have successfully applied FlexEmu to model 12 kinds of MCU peripherals. Our evaluation on 90 firmware samples across 15 different MCU platforms shows that the automatically generated emulators can faithfully replicate hardware behaviors and achieve a 98.48% unit test passing rate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the implications of FlexEmu on firmware security, we use the generated emulators to fuzz three popular RTOSes and uncover 10 previously unknown bugs.",2025-09-09 11:38:30+00:00,2025-09-09 11:38:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07615v1
Extension of Spatial k-Anonymity: New Metrics for Assessing the Anonymity of Geomasked Data Considering Realistic Attack Scenarios,"Spatial data are gaining increasing importance in many areas of research. Particularly spatial health data are becoming increasingly important for medical research, for example, to better understand relationships between environmental factors and disease patterns. However, their use is often restricted by legal data protection regulations, since georeferenced personal information carries a high risk of re-identification of individuals. To address this issue, what are called geomasking methods are applied to guarantee data protection through targeted displacement of individual data points, while simultaneously maintaining analytical validity within a tolerable range. In the current literature the degree of anonymity of such anonymized georeferenced datasets is often measured by the so-called metric of spatial k-anonymity. However, this metric has considerable shortcomings, particularly regarding its resilience against realistic data attack scenarios. This article classifies the potential data attack scenarios in the context of anonymized georeferenced microdata and introduces appropriate metrics that enable a comprehensive assessment of anonymity adapted to potential data attack scenarios.",2025-09-09 08:38:52+00:00,2025-09-09 08:38:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07505v1
A Decade-long Landscape of Advanced Persistent Threats: Longitudinal Analysis and Global Trends,"An advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to a covert, long-term cyberattack, typically conducted by state-sponsored actors, targeting critical sectors and often remaining undetected for long periods. In response, collective intelligence from around the globe collaborates to identify and trace surreptitious activities, generating substantial documentation on APT campaigns publicly available on the web. While prior works predominantly focus on specific aspects of APT cases, such as detection, evaluation, cyber threat intelligence, and dataset creation, limited attention has been devoted to revisiting and investigating these scattered dossiers in a longitudinal manner. The objective of our study is to fill the gap by offering a macro perspective, connecting key insights and global trends in past APT attacks. We systematically analyze six reliable sources-three focused on technical reports and another three on threat actors-examining 1,509 APT dossiers (24,215 pages) spanning 2014-2023, and identifying 603 unique APT groups worldwide. To efficiently unearth relevant information, we employ a hybrid methodology that combines rule-based information retrieval with large-language-model-based search techniques. Our longitudinal analysis reveals shifts in threat actor activities, global attack vectors, changes in targeted sectors, and relationships between cyberattacks and significant events such as elections or wars, which provide insights into historical patterns in APT evolution. Over the past decade, 154 countries have been affected, primarily using malicious documents and spear phishing as dominant initial infiltration vectors, with a noticeable decline in zero-day exploitation since 2016. Furthermore, we present our findings through interactive visualization tools, such as an APT map or flow diagram, to facilitate intuitive understanding of global patterns and trends in APT activities.",2025-09-09 07:26:15+00:00,2025-09-09 07:26:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07457v1
zkUnlearner: A Zero-Knowledge Framework for Verifiable Unlearning with Multi-Granularity and Forgery-Resistance,"As the demand for exercising the ""right to be forgotten"" grows, the need for verifiable machine unlearning has become increasingly evident to ensure both transparency and accountability. We present {\em zkUnlearner}, the first zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning, specifically designed to support {\em multi-granularity} and {\em forgery-resistance}.   First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning. Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.",2025-09-08 23:50:35+00:00,2025-09-08 23:50:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07290v1
ALICE: An Interpretable Neural Architecture for Generalization in Substitution Ciphers,"We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network reasoning and generalization; models must decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment), a simple encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction ($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit and probing experiments, we reveal how ALICE progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common human strategies -- early layers place greater emphasis on letter frequencies, while later layers form word-level structures. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods are applicable beyond cryptograms and offer new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.",2025-09-25 01:15:04+00:00,2025-09-08 23:33:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07282v2
Quantum Advantage via Solving Multivariate Polynomials,"In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably) demonstrate quantum advantage by solving the average-case $\mathsf{NP}$ search problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) constant degree multivariate equations over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ drawn from a specified distribution. In particular, for any $d \geq 2$, we design a distribution of degree up to $d$ polynomials $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\}_{i\in [m]}$ for $m<n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which we show that there is a expected polynomial-time quantum algorithm that provably simultaneously solves $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=y_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ for a random vector $(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. On the other hand, while solutions exist with high probability, we conjecture that for constant $d > 2$, it is classically hard to find one based on a thorough review of existing classical cryptanalysis. Our work thus posits that degree three functions are enough to instantiate the random oracle to obtain non-relativized quantum advantage.   Our approach begins with the breakthrough Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022) quantum algorithmic framework. In our work, we demonstrate that this quantum algorithmic framework extends to the setting of multivariate polynomial systems.   Our key technical contribution is a new analysis on the Fourier spectra of distributions induced by a general family of distributions over $\mathbb{F}_2$ multivariate polynomials -- those that satisfy $2$-wise independence and shift-invariance. This family of distributions includes the distribution of uniform random degree at most $d$ polynomials for any constant $d \geq 2$. Our analysis opens up potentially new directions for quantum cryptanalysis of other multivariate systems.",2025-09-08 23:19:20+00:00,2025-09-08 23:19:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07276v1

Experiments show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders of magnitude smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a few hundred examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in \textit{under} one training run, unlike prior methods needing full model training.",2025-11-14 18:24:49+00:00,2025-09-08 17:57:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07055v2
"Neuro-Symbolic AI for Cybersecurity: State of the Art, Challenges, and Opportunities","Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit fundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to non-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding analyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.",2025-09-08 17:33:59+00:00,2025-09-08 17:33:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06921v1
Imitative Membership Inference Attack,"A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a target machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were part of the training set. State-of-the-art MIAs rely on training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model, leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.",2025-09-08 15:27:35+00:00,2025-09-08 15:27:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06796v1
Image Encryption Scheme Based on Hyper-Chaotic Map and Self-Adaptive Diffusion,"In the digital age, image encryption technology acts as a safeguard, preventing unauthorized access to images. This paper proposes an innovative image encryption scheme that integrates a novel 2D hyper-chaotic map with a newly developed self-adaptive diffusion method. The 2D hyper-chaotic map, namely the 2D-RA map, is designed by hybridizing the Rastrigin and Ackley functions. The chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map is validated through a series of measurements, including the Bifurcation Diagram, Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Initial Value Sensitivity, 0 - 1 Test, Correlation Dimension (CD), and Kolmogorov Entropy (KE). The results demonstrate that the chaotic performance of the 2D-RA map surpasses that of existing advanced chaotic functions. Additionally, the self-adaptive diffusion method is employed to enhance the uniformity of grayscale distribution. The performance of the image encryption scheme is evaluated using a series of indicators. The results show that the proposed image encryption scheme significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art image encryption techniques.

When Secure Isn't: Assessing the Security of Machine Learning Model Sharing,"The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best, often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy, despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.",2025-09-19 15:22:16+00:00,2025-09-08 13:55:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06703v2
Network-level Censorship Attacks in the InterPlanetary File System,"The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has been successfully established as the de facto standard for decentralized data storage in the emerging Web3. Despite its decentralized nature, IPFS nodes, as well as IPFS content providers, have converged to centralization in large public clouds. Centralization introduces BGP routing-based attacks, such as passive interception and BGP hijacking, as potential threats. Although this attack vector has been investigated for many other Web3 protocols, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been analyzed for the IPFS network. In our work, we bridge this gap and demonstrate that BGP routing attacks can be effectively leveraged to censor content in IPFS. For the analysis, we collected 3,000 content blocks called CIDs and conducted a simulation of BGP hijacking and passive interception against them. We find that a single malicious AS can censor 75% of the IPFS content for more than 57% of all requester nodes. Furthermore, we show that even with a small set of only 62 hijacked prefixes, 70% of the full attack effectiveness can already be reached. We further propose and validate countermeasures based on global collaborative content replication among all nodes in the IPFS network, together with additional robust backup content provider nodes that are well-hardened against BGP hijacking. We hope this work raises awareness about the threat BGP routing-based attacks pose to IPFS and triggers further efforts to harden the live IPFS network against them.",2025-09-08 12:42:47+00:00,2025-09-08 12:42:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06626v1
A Secure Sequencer and Data Availability Committee for Rollups (Extended Version),"Blockchains face a scalability limitation, partly due to the throughput limitations of consensus protocols, especially when aiming to obtain a high degree of decentralization. Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to conventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using minimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer is a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these transactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing needs less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data availability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their corresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and DACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential security threat and delaying L2 adoption. We propose in this paper fraud-proof mechanisms, arbitrated by L1 contracts, to detect and generate evidence of dishonest behavior of the sequencer and DAC. We study how these fraud-proofs limit the power of adversaries that control different number of sequencer and DACs members, and provide incentives for their honest behavior. We designed these fraud-proof mechanisms as two player games. Unlike the generic fraud-proofs in current L2s (designed to guarantee the correct execution of transactions), our fraud-proofs are over pred-etermined algorithms that verify the properties that determine the correctness of the DAC. Arbitrating over concrete algorithms makes our fraud-proofs more efficient, easier to understand, and simpler to prove correct. We provide as an artifact a mechanization in LEAN4 of our fraud-proof games, including (1) the verified strategies that honest players should play to win all games as well as (2) mechanisms to detect dishonest claims.",2025-09-09 21:07:49+00:00,2025-09-08 12:32:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06614v2
A Simple Data Exfiltration Game,"Data exfiltration is a growing problem for business who face costs related to the loss of confidential data as well as potential extortion. This work presents a simple game theoretic model of network data exfiltration.

The attacker is rewarded for exfiltrating data, and the defender tries to minimize the costs of data loss and of responding to alerts.",2025-09-08 11:35:25+00:00,2025-09-08 11:35:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06571v1
Marginal sets in semigroups and semirings,"In 2019, V. A. Roman'kov introduced the concept of marginal sets for groups.

For tropical matrix semigroups and semirings, we describe how some marginal sets can be constructed. We apply marginal sets to improve some key exchange schemes over semigroups.",2025-09-08 11:22:25+00:00,2025-09-08 11:22:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06562v1
Super-Quadratic Quantum Speed-ups and Guessing Many Likely Keys,"We study the fundamental problem of guessing cryptographic keys, drawn from some non-uniform probability distribution $D$, as e.g. in LPN, LWE or for passwords. The optimal classical algorithm enumerates keys in decreasing order of likelihood. The optimal quantum algorithm, due to Montanaro (2011), is a sophisticated Grover search.   We give the first tight analysis for Montanaro's algorithm, showing that its runtime is $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$, where $H_α(\cdot)$ denotes Renyi entropy with parameter $α$. Interestingly, this is a direct consequence of an information theoretic result called Arikan's Inequality (1996) -- which has so far been missed in the cryptographic community -- that tightly bounds the runtime of classical key guessing by $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$. Since $H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$ for every non-uniform distribution $D$, we thus obtain a super-quadratic quantum speed-up $s>2$ over classical key guessing.   As another main result, we provide the first thorough analysis of guessing in a multi-key setting. Specifically, we consider the task of attacking many keys sampled independently from some distribution $D$, and aim to guess a fraction of them. For product distributions $D = χ^n$, we show that any constant fraction of keys can be guessed within $2^{H(D)}$ classically and $2 ^{H(D)/2}$ quantumly per key, where $H(χ)$ denotes Shannon entropy. In contrast, Arikan's Inequality implies that guessing a single key costs $2^{H_{1/2}(D)}$ classically and $2^{H_{2/3}(D)/2}$ quantumly. Since $H(D) < H_{2/3}(D) < H_{1/2}(D)$, this shows that in a multi-key setting the guessing cost per key is substantially smaller than in a single-key setting, both classically and quantumly.",2025-09-08 11:03:49+00:00,2025-09-08 11:03:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06549v1
AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs,"As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.",2025-09-08 04:17:02+00:00,2025-09-08 04:17:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326v1
Schrodinger's Toolbox: Exploring the Quantum Rowhammer Attack,"Residual cross-talk in superconducting qubit devices creates a security vulnerability for emerging quantum cloud services. We demonstrate a Clifford-only Quantum Rowhammer attack-using just X and CNOT gates-that injects faults on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processors without requiring pulse-level access. Experiments show that targeted hammering induces localized errors confined to the attack cycle and primarily manifests as phase noise, as confirmed by near 50% flip rates under Hadamard-basis probing. A full lattice sweep maps QR's spatial and temporal behavior, revealing reproducible corruption limited to qubits within two coupling hops and rapid recovery in subsequent benign cycles. Finally, we leverage these properties to outline a prime-and-probe covert channel, demonstrating that the clear separability between hammered and benign rounds enables highly reliable signaling without error correction. These findings underscore the need for hardware-level isolation and scheduler-aware defenses as multi-tenant quantum computing becomes standard.",2025-09-08 03:55:17+00:00,2025-09-08 03:55:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06318v1
PLRV-O: Advancing Differentially Private Deep Learning via Privacy Loss Random Variable Optimization,"Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration, (iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.",2025-09-08 01:06:45+00:00,2025-09-08 01:06:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06264v1
Lightweight Intrusion Detection System Using a Hybrid CNN and ConvNeXt-Tiny Model for Internet of Things Networks,"The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems across various domains such as industry, smart cities, healthcare, manufacturing, and government services has led to a significant increase in security risks, threatening data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Consequently, ensuring the security and resilience of IoT systems has become a critical requirement. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT environments, leveraging a hybrid model of CNN and ConvNeXt-Tiny. The proposed method is designed to detect and classify different types of network attacks, particularly botnet and malicious traffic, while the lightweight ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture enables effective deployment in resource-constrained devices and networks. A real-world dataset comprising both benign and malicious network packets collected from practical IoT scenarios was employed in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing training and inference time compared to more complex models. Specifically, the system attained 99.63% accuracy in the testing phase, 99.67% accuracy in the training phase, and an error rate of 0.0107 across eight classes, while maintaining short response times and low resource consumption. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and classifying attacks in real-world IoT environments, indicating that the lightweight architecture can serve as a practical alternative to complex and resource-intensive approaches in IoT network security.",2025-09-07 20:32:38+00:00,2025-09-07 20:32:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06202v1
Measuring the Vulnerability Disclosure Policies of AI Vendors,"As AI is increasingly integrated into products and critical systems, researchers are paying greater attention to identifying related vulnerabilities. Effective remediation depends on whether vendors are willing to accept and respond to AI vulnerability reports. In this paper, we examine the disclosure policies of 264 AI vendors. Using a mixed-methods approach, our quantitative analysis finds that 36% of vendors provide no disclosure channel, and only 18% explicitly mention AI-related risks. Vulnerabilities involving data access, authorization, and model extraction are generally considered in-scope, while jailbreaking and hallucination are frequently excluded. Through qualitative analysis, we further identify three vendor postures toward AI vulnerabilities - proactive clarification (n = 46, include active supporters, AI integrationists, and back channels), silence (n = 115, include self-hosted and hosted vendors), and restrictive (n = 103). Finally, by comparing vendor policies against 1,130 AI incidents and 359 academic publications, we show that bug bounty policy evolution has lagged behind both academic research and real-world events.",2025-09-07 16:44:28+00:00,2025-09-07 16:44:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06136v1
"VehiclePassport: A GAIA-X-Aligned, Blockchain-Anchored Privacy-Preserving, Zero-Knowledge Digital Passport for Smart Vehicles","Modern vehicles accumulate fragmented lifecycle records across OEMs, owners, and service centers that are difficult to verify and prone to fraud. We propose VehiclePassport, a GAIA-X-aligned digital passport anchored on blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification. VehiclePassport immutably commits to manufacturing, telemetry, and service events while enabling selective disclosure via short-lived JWTs and Groth16 proofs. Our open-source reference stack anchors hashes on Polygon zkEVM at <$0.02 per event, validates proofs in <10 ms, and scales to millions of vehicles. This architecture eliminates paper-based KYC, ensures GDPR-compliant traceability, and establishes a trustless foundation for insurance, resale, and regulatory applications in global mobility data markets.",2025-09-07 16:40:30+00:00,2025-09-07 16:40:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06133v1
CSI-IBBS: Identity-Based Blind Signature using CSIDH,"Identity-based cryptography (IBC), proposed by Adi Shamir, revolutionized public key authentication by eliminating the need for certificates, enabling a more efficient and scalable approach to cryptographic systems. Meanwhile, in \cite{Katsumata2024group}, Katsumata et al. were the first to present the blind signature protocol based on the hardness assumption of isogeny with provable security, which resembles the Schnorr blind signature. Building upon these foundational concepts, we propose an Identity-Based Blind Signature Scheme with an Honest Zero-Knowledge Verifier utilizing the CSIDH framework. This scheme combines blind signatures for privacy preservation with zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the verifier's honesty without revealing any additional information.   Leveraging the quantum-resistant properties of CSIDH, a post-quantum secure scheme based on supersingular isogenies, our scheme offers strong protection against quantum adversaries while maintaining computational efficiency. We analyze the security of the introduced protocol in the standard cryptographic model and demonstrate its effectiveness in safeguarding privacy and verifier honesty. Furthermore, we present a performance evaluation, confirming the practical viability of this quantum-resistant cryptographic solution for privacy-preserving applications. This work advances the creation of secure, and scalable cryptographic systems for the post-quantum era.",2025-09-07 16:31:16+00:00,2025-09-07 16:31:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06127v1
"Decentralized Identity Management on Ripple: A Conceptual Framework for High-Speed, Low-Cost Identity Transactions in Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Identity","Recent years have seen many industrial implementations and much scholastic research, i.e., prototypes and theoretical frameworks, in Decentralized Identity Management Systems (DIDMS). It is safe to say that Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Decentralized IDM (ABABDIDM) has not received anywhere near the same level of attention in the literature as general Attribute-Based DIDMs (ABDIDM), i.e, decentralized Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The use of decentralization, i.e., DIDM, is to improve upon the security and privacy-related issues of centralized Identity Management Systems (IDM) and Attribute-Based IDMs (ABIDM). And blockchain is the framework used for decentralization in all these schemes. Many DIDMs - even ABDIDMs - have been defined on popular blockchains such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. However, despite the characteristics of Ripple that makes it appealing for an ABIDM, there is a lack of research to develop an Identity Management System (IDMS) on Ripple in literature. We have attempted to conceptualize an ABABDIDM on Ripple.",2025-11-23 12:01:52+00:00,2025-09-07 14:12:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10545v2
MemTraceDB: Reconstructing MySQL User Activity Using ActiviTimeTrace Algorithm,"Database audit and transaction logs are fundamental to forensic investigations, but they are vulnerable to tampering by privileged attackers. Malicious insiders or external threats with administrative access can alter, purge, or temporarily disable logging mechanisms, creating significant blind spots and rendering disk-based records unreliable. Memory analysis offers a vital alternative, providing investigators direct access to volatile artifacts that represent a ground-truth source of recent user activity, even when log files have been compromised.   This paper introduces MemTraceDB, a tool that reconstructs user activity timelines by analyzing raw memory snapshots from the MySQL database process. MemTraceDB utilizes a novel algorithm, ActiviTimeTrace, to systematically extract and correlate forensic artifacts such as user connections and executed queries. Through a series of experiments, I demonstrate MemTraceDB's effectiveness and reveal a critical empirical finding: the MySQL query stack has a finite operational capacity of approximately 9,997 queries. This discovery allows me to establish a practical, data-driven formula for determining the optimal frequency for memory snapshot collection, providing a clear, actionable guideline for investigators. The result is a forensically-sound reconstruction of user activity, independent of compromised disk-based logs.",2025-09-07 01:53:34+00:00,2025-09-07 01:53:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05891v1
Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage. These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks.   To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection.",2025-09-07 01:11:10+00:00,2025-09-07 01:11:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883v1
Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.",2025-11-11 06:53:21+00:00,2025-09-06 21:05:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831v3
Secure and Trustful Cross-domain Communication with Decentralized Identifiers in 5G and Beyond,"In the evolving landscape of future mobile networks, there is a critical need for secure and trustful communication modalities to support dynamic interactions among core network components of different network domains. This paper proposes the application of W3C-endorsed Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to establish secure and trustful communication channels among network functions in 5G and subsequent generations. A new communication agent is introduced that integrates seamlessly with 5G-standardized network functions and utilizes a DID-based application layer transport protocol to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for cross-domain interactions. A comparative analysis of the two different versions of the DID-based communication protocol for inter network function communication reveals compatibility advantages of the latest protocol iteration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the communication overhead caused by both protocol iterations compared to traditional TCP/TLS shows the benefits of using DIDs to improve communication security, albeit with performance loses compared to TCP/TLS. These results uncover the potential of DID-based communication for future mobile networks but also point out areas for optimization.",2025-09-06 18:20:01+00:00,2025-09-06 18:20:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05797v1
On the Security of Tool-Invocation Prompts for LLM-Based Agentic Systems: An Empirical Risk Assessment,"LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.",2025-09-19 17:17:58+00:00,2025-09-06 15:48:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v4
Tell-Tale Watermarks for Explanatory Reasoning in Synthetic Media Forensics,"The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability.",2025-09-06 15:47:27+00:00,2025-09-06 15:47:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05753v1
Reasoning Introduces New Poisoning Attacks Yet Makes Them More Complicated,"Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.   Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.",2025-09-06 15:06:18+00:00,2025-09-06 15:06:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05739v1
Larger-scale Nakamoto-style Blockchains Offer Better Security,"Traditional security models for Nakamoto-style blockchains overestimate adversarial coordination by assuming instantaneous synchronization among malicious nodes, neglecting the critical impact of internal communication delays on security. This paper introduces a dual-delay framework to revisit security analysis, addressing this oversight through two key innovations. First, the static delay model quantifies how adversarial communication delays (\(Δ_a\)) constrain the effective growth rate of private chains, derived via an M/D/1 queuing model as \(λ_{eff} = λ_a / (1 + λ_a Δ_a)\). This model reveals that the security threshold (\(β^*\)), the maximum adversarial power the system tolerates, increases with \(Δ_a\), even exceeding the classic 51\% boundary when \(Δ_a \textgreater Δ\) (honest nodes' delay), breaking the long-standing 50\% assumption. Second, the dynamic delay model integrates probabilistic corruption and scale-dependent delays to characterize the total adversarial delay window (\(Δ_{total} = Δ(n) e^{-kβ} + c \log(1 + βn)\)), where \(Δ(n) \in Θ(\log n)\) captures honest nodes' logarithmic delay growth. Asymptotic analysis shows adversarial power decays linearly with network scale, ensuring the probability of \(β\leq β^*\) approaches 1 as \(n \to \infty\). By exposing the interplay between network scale, communication delays, and power dilution, we provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing consensus protocols and assessing robustness in large-scale Nakamoto-style blockchains.",2025-09-18 14:52:34+00:00,2025-09-06 13:00:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05708v2
GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.",2025-09-06 10:23:17+00:00,2025-09-06 10:23:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671v1
FuzzBox: Blending Fuzzing into Emulation for Binary-Only Embedded Targets,"Coverage-guided fuzzing has been widely applied to address zero-day vulnerabilities in general-purpose software and operating systems. This approach relies on instrumenting the target code at compile time. However, applying it to industrial systems remains challenging, due to proprietary and closed-source compiler toolchains and lack of access to source code. FuzzBox addresses these limitations by integrating emulation with fuzzing: it dynamically instruments code during execution in a virtualized environment, for the injection of fuzz inputs, failure detection, and coverage analysis, without requiring source code recompilation and hardware-specific dependencies. We show the effectiveness of FuzzBox through experiments in the context of a proprietary MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) hypervisor for industrial applications. Additionally, we analyze the applicability of FuzzBox across commercial IoT firmware, showcasing its broad portability.",2025-09-06 08:31:36+00:00,2025-09-06 08:31:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05643v1
Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints,"The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.   We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.",2025-09-06 05:57:20+00:00,2025-09-06 05:57:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05608v1
EchoLeak: The First Real-World Zero-Click Prompt Injection Exploit in a Production LLM System,"Large language model (LLM) assistants are increasingly integrated into enterprise workflows, raising new security concerns as they bridge internal and external data sources. This paper presents an in-depth case study of EchoLeak (CVE-2025-32711), a zero-click prompt injection vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that enabled remote, unauthenticated data exfiltration via a single crafted email. By chaining multiple bypasses-evading Microsofts XPIA (Cross Prompt Injection Attempt) classifier, circumventing link redaction with reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing a Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by the content security policy-EchoLeak achieved full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction. We analyze why existing defenses failed, and outline a set of engineering mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced input/output filtering, provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies. Beyond the specific exploit, we derive generalizable lessons for building secure AI copilots, emphasizing the principle of least privilege, defense-in-depth architectures, and continuous adversarial testing. Our findings establish prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class in production AI systems and provide a blueprint for defending against future AI-native threats.",2025-09-06 04:06:01+00:00,2025-09-06 04:06:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10540v1
Differential Robustness in Transformer Language Models: Empirical Evaluation Under Adversarial Text Attacks,"This study evaluates the resilience of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on Flan-T5, BERT, and RoBERTa-Base. Using systematically designed adversarial tests through TextFooler and BERTAttack, we found significant variations in model robustness. RoBERTa-Base and FlanT5 demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining accuracy even when subjected to sophisticated attacks, with attack success rates of 0%. In contrast. BERT-Base showed considerable vulnerability, with TextFooler achieving a 93.75% success rate in reducing model accuracy from 48% to just 3%. Our research reveals that while certain LLMs have developed effective defensive mechanisms, these safeguards often require substantial computational resources. This study contributes to the understanding of LLM security by identifying existing strengths and weaknesses in current safeguarding approaches and proposes practical recommendations for developing more efficient and effective defensive strategies.",2025-09-05 21:43:06+00:00,2025-09-05 21:43:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09706v1
Bi-Level Game-Theoretic Planning of Cyber Deception for Cognitive Arbitrage,"Cognitive vulnerabilities shape human decision-making and arise primarily from two sources: (1) cognitive capabilities, which include disparities in knowledge, education, expertise, or access to information, and (2) cognitive biases, such as rational inattention, confirmation bias, and base rate neglect, which influence how individuals perceive and process information. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to gain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This paper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that leverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the proposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on ""strategic-level"" design for defensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates ""operational-level"" actions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the cross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage strategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's initial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed deception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive one during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total rewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even small initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and secure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the attacker's lifecycle.",2025-09-05 21:11:25+00:00,2025-09-05 21:11:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05498v1
Behind the Mask: Benchmarking Camouflaged Jailbreaks in Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts, containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards, Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score. Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the responsible and robust deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",2025-09-05 19:57:38+00:00,2025-09-05 19:57:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05471v1
Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.",2025-11-10 21:01:21+00:00,2025-09-05 18:17:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429v3
Verifiability and Privacy in Federated Learning through Context-Hiding Multi-Key Homomorphic Authenticators,"Federated Learning has rapidly expanded from its original inception to now have a large body of research, several frameworks, and sold in a variety of commercial offerings. Thus, its security and robustness is of significant importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with millions of parameters.",2025-10-01 08:42:12+00:00,2025-09-05 14:57:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05162v2
"Jamming Smarter, Not Harder: Exploiting O-RAN Y1 RAN Analytics for Efficient Interference","The Y1 interface in O-RAN enables the sharing of RAN Analytics Information (RAI) between the near-RT RIC and authorized Y1 consumers, which may be internal applications within the operator's trusted domain or external systems accessing data through a secure exposure function. While this visibility enhances network optimization and enables advanced services, it also introduces a potential security risk -- a malicious or compromised Y1 consumer could misuse analytics to facilitate targeted interference. In this work, we demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective jamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and evaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging DBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared against two baselines strategies -- always-on jammer and random jammer -- on an over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in unconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely replicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing transmission time by 27\%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the clustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1\% bitrate drop while remaining active only 25\% of the time. These findings reveal a critical trade-off between jamming stealthiness and efficiency, and illustrate how exposure of RAN analytics via the Y1 interface can enable highly targeted, low-overhead attacks, raising important security considerations for both civilian and mission-critical O-RAN deployments.",2025-09-05 14:57:18+00:00,2025-09-05 14:57:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05161v1
From Protest to Power Plant: Interpreting the Role of Escalatory Hacktivism in Cyber Conflict,"Since 2022, hacktivist groups have escalated their tactics, expanding from distributed denial-of-service attacks and document leaks to include targeting operational technology (OT). By 2024, attacks on the OT of critical national infrastructure (CNI) had been linked to partisan hacktivist efforts in ongoing geopolitical conflicts, demonstrating a shift from protest to something more resembling cyber warfare. This escalation raises critical questions about the classification of these groups and the appropriate state response to their growing role in destabilizing international security.   This paper examines the strategic motivations behind escalatory hacktivism, highlighting how states may tolerate, encourage, or leverage hacktivist groups as proxies in conflicts that blur the lines between activism, cybercrime, and state-sponsored operations. We introduce a novel method for interpreting hacktivists based on the impact of their actions, alignment to state ideology, and host state involvement, offering a structured approach to understanding the phenomenon. Finally, we assess policy and security implications, particularly for host and victim states, and propose strategies to address this evolving threat. By doing so, this paper contributes to international discussions on cyber security policy, governance, and the increasing intersection between non-state cyber actors and state interests.",2025-10-06 15:49:14+00:00,2025-09-05 13:41:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05104v2
FuzzRDUCC: Fuzzing with Reconstructed Def-Use Chain Coverage,"Binary-only fuzzing often struggles with achieving thorough code coverage and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities due to limited insight into a program's internal dataflows. Traditional grey-box fuzzers guide test case generation primarily using control flow edge coverage, which can overlook bugs not easily exposed through control flow analysis alone. We argue that integrating dataflow analysis into the fuzzing process can enhance its effectiveness by revealing how data propagates through the program, thereby enabling the exploration of execution paths that control flow-based methods might miss. In this context, we introduce FuzzRDUCC, a novel fuzzing framework that employs symbolic execution to reconstruct definition-use (def-use) chains directly from binary executables. FuzzRDUCC identifies crucial dataflow paths and exposes security vulnerabilities without incurring excessive computational overhead, due to a novel heuristic algorithm that selects relevant def-use chains without affecting the thoroughness of the fuzzing process. We evaluate FuzzRDUCC using the binutils benchmark and demonstrate that it can identify unique crashes not found by state-of-the-art fuzzers. Hence, establishing FuzzRDUCC as a feasible solution for next generation vulnerability detection and discovery mechanisms.",2025-09-05 09:47:34+00:00,2025-09-05 09:47:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04967v1
Ratio1 -- AI meta-OS,"We propose the Ratio1 AI meta-operating system (meta-OS), a decentralized MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops, smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS), homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based apps at scale. The protocol enforces a formal circular token-economic model combining Proof-of-Availability (PoA) and Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus. Compared to centralized heterogeneous cloud MLOps and existing decentralized compute platforms, which often lack integrated AI toolchains or trusted Ratio1 node operators (R1OP) mechanics, Ratio1's holistic design lowers barriers for AI deployment and improves cost-efficiency. We provide mathematical formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue that our proposed fully functional ecosystem proposes and demonstrates significant improvements in accessibility, scalability, and security over existing alternatives.",2025-09-05 07:41:54+00:00,2025-09-05 07:41:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12223v1
Where Have All the Firewalls Gone? Security Consequences of Residential IPv6 Transition,"IPv4 NAT has limited the spread of IoT botnets considerably by default-denying bots' incoming connection requests to in-home devices unless the owner has explicitly allowed them. As the Internet transitions to majority IPv6, however, residential connections no longer require the use of NAT. This paper therefore asks: has the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 ultimately made residential networks more vulnerable to attack, thereby empowering the next generation of IPv6-based IoT botnets? To answer this question, we introduce a large-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can be run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets. We use this methodology to perform the largest-scale measurement of IPv6 residential networks to date, and compare which devices are publicly accessible to comparable IPv4 networks. We were able to receive responses from 14.0M distinct IPv6 addresses inside of residential networks (i.e., not the external-facing gateway), in 2,436 ASes across 118 countries. These responses come from protocols commonly exploited by IoT botnets (including telnet and FTP), as well as protocols typically associated with end-user devices (including iPhone-Sync and IPP). Comparing to IPv4, we show that we are able to reach more printers, iPhones, and smart lights over IPv6 than full IPv4-wide scans could. Collectively, our results show that NAT has indeed acted as the de facto firewall of the Internet, and the v4-to-v6 transition of residential networks is opening up new devices to attack.",2025-09-05 04:09:47+00:00,2025-09-05 04:09:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04792v1
Network-Aware Differential Privacy,"Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy-enhancement technology (PET) that receives prominent attention from the academia, industry, and government. One main development over the past decade has been the decentralization of DP, including local DP and shuffle DP. Despite that decentralized DP heavily relies on network communications for data collection,we found that: 1) no systematic study has surveyed the research opportunities at the intersection of networking and DP; 2) nor have there been significant efforts to develop DP mechanisms that are explicitly tailored for network environments. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by initiating a new direction of network-aware DP. We identified two focus areas where the network research can offer substantive contributions to the design and deployment of DP, related to network security and topology. Through this work, we hope to encourage more research that adapt/optimize DP's deployment in various network environments.",2025-09-04 23:53:54+00:00,2025-09-04 23:53:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04710v1
Breaking to Build: A Threat Model of Prompt-Based Attacks for Securing LLMs,"The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.",2025-09-04 18:59:07+00:00,2025-09-04 18:59:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04615v1
Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.",2025-09-04 17:13:59+00:00,2025-09-04 17:13:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1
"An Automated, Scalable Machine Learning Model Inversion Assessment Pipeline","Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.",2025-09-04 13:39:37+00:00,2025-09-04 13:39:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04214v1
Privacy Preservation and Identity Tracing Prevention in AI-Driven Eye Tracking for Interactive Learning Environments,"Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization, ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63% accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.40%.",2025-09-04 13:08:06+00:00,2025-09-04 13:08:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05376v1
ECCFROG522PP: An Enhanced 522-bit Weierstrass Elliptic Curve,"Whilst many key exchange and digital signature systems still rely on NIST P-256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1, offering around 128-bit security, there is an increasing demand for transparent and reproducible curves at the 256-bit security level. Standard higher-security options include NIST P-521, Curve448, and Brainpool-P512. This paper presents ECCFROG522PP (""Presunto Powered""), a 522-bit prime-field elliptic curve that delivers security in the same classical approx 260-bit ballpark as NIST P-521, but with a fundamentally different design philosophy. All of the curve parameters are deterministically derived from a fixed public seed via BLAKE3, with zero hidden choices. The curve has prime order (cofactor = 1), a verified twist with a proven approx 505-bit prime factor, safe embedding degree (greater than or equal to 14), and passes anti-MOV checks up to k less than or equal to 200 and CM discriminant sanity up to 100k. Unlike prior opaque or ad-hoc constructions, ECCFROG522PP is fully reproducible: anyone can regenerate and verify it byte-for-byte using the published scripts. The intent is not to outperform NIST P-521 in raw speed, but to maximise trust, verifiability, and long-term auditability in a practical curve of equivalent security level",2025-09-05 09:39:12+00:00,2025-09-04 10:57:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04097v2
Error Detection Schemes for Barrett Reduction of CT-BU on FPGA in Post Quantum Cryptography,"A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection. While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is nearly 100%.",2025-09-04 10:03:47+00:00,2025-09-04 10:03:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04070v1
NeuroBreak: Unveil Internal Jailbreak Mechanisms in Large Language Models,"In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving jailbreak attacks.",2025-09-04 08:12:06+00:00,2025-09-04 08:12:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03985v1
Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Exploiting Ethical Reasoning to Jailbreak LLMs,"Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.",2025-09-12 11:05:08+00:00,2025-09-04 05:53:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05367v2
The Auth Shim: A Lightweight Architectural Pattern for Integrating Enterprise SSO with Standalone Open-Source Applications,"Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC, creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components, interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.",2025-09-12 10:44:36+00:00,2025-09-04 05:48:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03900v2
A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models,"The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

"Rethinking Tamper-Evident Logging: A High-Performance, Co-Designed Auditing System","Existing tamper-evident logging systems suffer from high overhead and severe data loss in high-load settings, yet only provide coarse-grained tamper detection. Moreover, installing such systems requires recompiling kernel code. To address these challenges, we present Nitro, a high-performance, tamper-evident audit logging system that supports fine-grained detection of log tampering. Even better, our system avoids kernel recompilation by using the eBPF technology. To formally justify the security of Nitro, we provide a new definitional framework for logging systems, and give a practical cryptographic construction meeting this new goal. Unlike prior work that focus only on the cryptographic processing, we codesign the cryptographic part with the pre- and post-processing of the logs to exploit all system-level optimizations. Our evaluations demonstrate Nitro's superior performance, achieving 10X-25X improvements in high-stress conditions and 2X-10X in real-world scenarios while maintaining near-zero data loss. We also provide an advanced variant, Nitro-R that introduces in-kernel log reduction techniques to reduce runtime overhead even further.",2025-09-05 21:13:13+00:00,2025-09-04 02:12:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03821v2
A Quantum Genetic Algorithm-Enhanced Self-Supervised Intrusion Detection System for Wireless Sensor Networks in the Internet of Things,"The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has significantly increased the attack surface of such systems, making them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of resource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and reliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages quantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and fine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in resource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust representations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually labeled training sets. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT intrusion datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency compared to conventional evolutionary and deep learning-based IDS models. The results highlight the potential of combining quantum-inspired optimization with self-supervised paradigms to design next-generation intrusion detection solutions for IoT and WSN environments.",2025-09-03 22:02:39+00:00,2025-09-03 22:02:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03744v1
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing,"Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.   In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects, where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security practices.",2025-09-03 20:54:43+00:00,2025-09-03 20:54:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03711v1
SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models,"Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models.

These techniques typically rely on extracting features at different levels from IoT applications, giving rise to a wide range of feature extraction methods. However, current approaches still face significant challenges when applied in practice. This survey provides a comprehensive review of feature extraction techniques for IoT malware analysis from multiple perspectives.

Federated Learning: An approach with Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption,"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that promises privacy by keeping the data on the device. However, gradient reconstruction and membership-inference attacks show that model updates still leak information. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can address those privacy concerns but it suffers from ciphertext expansion and requires prohibitive overhead on resource-constrained devices. We propose the first Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) framework for FL that pairs the PASTA symmetric cipher with the BFV FHE scheme. Clients encrypt local model updates with PASTA and send both the lightweight ciphertexts and the PASTA key (itself BFV-encrypted) to the server, which performs a homomorphic evaluation of the decryption circuit of PASTA and aggregates the resulting BFV ciphertexts. A prototype implementation, developed on top of the Flower FL framework, shows that on independently and identically distributed MNIST dataset with 12 clients and 10 training rounds, the proposed HHE system achieves 97.6% accuracy, just 1.3% below plaintext, while reducing client upload bandwidth by over 2,000x and cutting client runtime by 30% compared to a system based solely on the BFV FHE scheme. However, server computational cost increases by roughly 15621x for each client participating in the training phase, a challenge to be addressed in future work.",2025-09-03 15:58:22+00:00,2025-09-03 15:58:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03427v1
Prototype-Guided Robust Learning against Backdoor Attacks,"Backdoor attacks poison the training data to embed a backdoor in the model, causing it to behave normally on legitimate inputs but maliciously when specific trigger signals appear. Training a benign model from a dataset poisoned by backdoor attacks is challenging. Existing works rely on various assumptions and can only defend against backdoor attacks with specific trigger signals, high poisoning ratios, or when the defender possesses a large, untainted, validation dataset. In this paper, we propose a defense called Prototype-Guided Robust Learning (PGRL), which overcomes all the aforementioned limitations, being robust against diverse backdoor attacks. Leveraging a tiny set of benign samples, PGRL generates prototype vectors to guide the training process. We compare our PGRL with 8 existing defenses, showing that it achieves superior robustness. We also demonstrate that PGRL generalizes well across various architectures, datasets, and advanced attacks. Finally, to evaluate our PGRL in the worst-case scenario, we perform an adaptive attack, where the attackers fully know the details of the defense.",2025-09-03 14:41:54+00:00,2025-09-03 14:41:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08748v1
Silent Until Sparse: Backdoor Attacks on Semi-Structured Sparsity,"In the deployment phase, semi-structured sparsity accelerates the execution of deep neural networks on modern GPUs via sparse matrix multiplication. In this paper, targeting the semi-structured sparsity, we introduce a Silent Until Sparse (SUS) backdoor attack, where the released full model remains silent (benign), but becomes a backdoored model after sparsification. The attack operates in two phases: (i) in the backdoor training phase, the backdoor functionality is injected into specific weights that will be retained during the pruning process; (ii) in the backdoor hiding phase, the malicious behavior is concealed by fine-tuning elements that will be pruned away. This dual-phase approach ensures that the attack remains undetectable in the released model, but activates properly once the model is pruned with the semi-structured sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our attack successfully threatens the semi-structured sparsity algorithms from both NVIDIA and PyTorch. Our empirical results show that, regardless of model architecture, the attack success rate of the released model remains below 10% prior to sparsification but exceeds 99% afterward. Moreover, we demonstrate that SUS attack is robust against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses and finetuning, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current model compression and deployment pipelines.",2025-09-03 14:37:58+00:00,2025-09-03 14:37:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08747v1
Exposing Privacy Risks in Anonymizing Clinical Data: Combinatorial Refinement Attacks on k-Anonymity Without Auxiliary Information,"Despite longstanding criticism from the privacy community, k-anonymity remains a widely used standard for data anonymization, mainly due to its simplicity, regulatory alignment, and preservation of data utility. However, non-experts often defend k-anonymity on the grounds that, in the absence of auxiliary information, no known attacks can compromise its protections. In this work, we refute this claim by introducing Combinatorial Refinement Attacks (CRA), a new class of privacy attacks targeting k-anonymized datasets produced using local recoding. This is the first method that does not rely on external auxiliary information or assumptions about the underlying data distribution. CRA leverages the utility-optimizing behavior of local recoding anonymization of ARX, which is a widely used open-source software for anonymizing data in clinical settings, to formulate a linear program that significantly reduces the space of plausible sensitive values. To validate our findings, we partnered with a network of free community health clinics, an environment where (1) auxiliary information is indeed hard to find due to the population they serve and (2) open-source k-anonymity solutions are attractive due to regulatory obligations and limited resources. Our results on real-world clinical microdata reveal that even in the absence of external information, established anonymization frameworks do not deliver the promised level of privacy, raising critical privacy concerns.",2025-09-03 14:36:06+00:00,2025-09-03 14:36:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03350v1
Stealth by Conformity: Evading Robust Aggregation through Adaptive Poisoning,"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm designed to address privacy concerns. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where Byzantine clients compromise the integrity of the global model by submitting malicious updates. Robust aggregation methods have been widely adopted to mitigate such threats, relying on the core assumption that malicious updates are inherently out-of-distribution and can therefore be identified and excluded before aggregating client updates. In this paper, we challenge this underlying assumption by showing that a model can be poisoned while keeping malicious updates within the main distribution. We propose Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP), an adaptive and evasive poisoning strategy that exploits side-channel feedback from the aggregation process to guide the attack. Specifically, the adversary continuously infers whether its malicious contribution has been incorporated into the global model and adapts accordingly. This enables a dynamic adjustment of the local loss function, balancing a malicious component with a camouflaging component, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the poisoning while evading robust aggregation defenses. CHAMP enables more effective and evasive poisoning, highlighting a fundamental limitation of existing robust aggregation defenses and underscoring the need for new strategies to secure federated learning against sophisticated adversaries. Our approach is evaluated in two datasets reaching an average increase of 47.07% in attack success rate against nine robust aggregation defenses.",2025-09-03 13:40:54+00:00,2025-09-03 13:40:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08746v1
Evaluating Security Properties in the Execution of Quantum Circuits,"Quantum computing is a disruptive technology that is expected to offer significant advantages in many critical fields (e.g. drug discovery and cryptography). The security of information processed by such machines is therefore paramount. Currently, modest Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are available. The goal of this work is to identify a practical, heuristic methodology to evaluate security properties, such as secrecy and integrity, while using quantum processors owned by potentially untrustworthy providers.",2025-09-03 13:37:10+00:00,2025-09-03 13:37:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03306v1
Security Issues on the OpenPLC project and corresponding solutions,"As Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) became a useful device and rose as an interesting research topic but remained expensive, multiple PLC simulators/emulators were introduced for various purposes. Open-source Programmable Logic Controller (OpenPLC) software, one of the most popular PLC simulators, is designed to be vendor-neutral and run on almost any computer or low-cost embedded devices, e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other controllers. The project succeeded in introducing itself as an affordable and practical solution for the high cost of real hardware PLCs. However, it still lacks appropriate securing methods, resulting in several vulnerabilities. Through a combination of threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, and practical experiments, this thesis provides valuable insights for developers, researchers, and engineers aiming to deploy OpenPLC securely in industrial environments. To this end, this work first conducts an in-depth analysis aimed to shed light on va! rious security challenges and vulnerabilities within the OpenPLC project. After that, an advanced control logic injection attack was performed. This attack modifies the user program maliciously, exploiting presented vulnerabilities. Finally, the work introduces a security-enhanced OpenPLC software called OpenPLC Aqua. The new software is equipped with a set of security solutions designed specifically to address the vulnerabilities to which current OpenPLC versions are prone.",2025-09-03 10:11:08+00:00,2025-09-03 10:11:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22664v1
TraceLLM: Security Diagnosis Through Traces and Smart Contracts in Ethereum,"Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code, proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover, across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability.",2025-09-03 05:53:56+00:00,2025-09-03 05:53:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03037v1
Closing the Visibility Gap: A Monitoring Framework for Verifiable Open RAN Operations,"Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is reshaping mobile network architecture by promoting openness, disaggregation, and cross-vendor interoperability. However, this architectural flexibility introduces new security challenges, especially in deployments where multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) jointly operate shared components. Existing Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) in O-RAN, as defined by governmental and industry standards, implicitly assume that authenticated components will comply with operational policies. However, this assumption creates a critical blind spot: misconfigured or compromised components can silently violate policies, misuse resources, or corrupt downstream processes (e.g., ML-based RIC xApps).   To address this critical gap, we propose a monitoring framework for low-trust O-RAN environments that proactively verifies configuration state and control behavior against tenant-defined policies. Our system provides scalable, verifiable oversight to enhance transparency and trust in O-RAN operations. We implement and evaluate the framework using standardized O-RAN configurations, with total processing latency of approximately 200 ms, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality for timely policy enforcement and compliance auditing in multi-MNO deployments.",2025-09-03 04:17:57+00:00,2025-09-03 04:17:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03000v1
Managing Correlations in Data and Privacy Demand,"Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to implement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them attractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP mechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic datasets, which we release for future research.",2025-09-02 22:03:13+00:00,2025-09-02 22:03:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02856v1
Ensembling Membership Inference Attacks Against Tabular Generative Models,"Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a principled framework for auditing the privacy of synthetic data generated by tabular generative models, where many diverse methods have been proposed that each exploit different privacy leakage signals. However, in realistic threat scenarios, an adversary must choose a single method without a priori guarantee that it will be the empirically highest performing option. We study this challenge as a decision theoretic problem under uncertainty and conduct the largest synthetic data privacy benchmark to date. Here, we find that no MIA constitutes a strictly dominant strategy across a wide variety of model architectures and dataset domains under our threat model. Motivated by these findings, we propose ensemble MIAs and show that unsupervised ensembles built on individual attacks offer empirically more robust, regret-minimizing strategies than individual attacks.",2025-09-02 18:44:07+00:00,2025-09-02 18:44:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05350v1
Die Verarbeitung medizinischer Forschungsdaten ohne datenschutzrechtliche Einwilligung: Der Korridor zwischen Anonymisierung und der Forschungsausnahme in Österreich,"Modern, data-driven medical research requires the processing of sensitive health data on a large scale. However, this data is subject to special protection under the GDPR, which is why processing regularly raises data protection concerns in practice. These concerns are particularly prevalent when sensitive personal data is processed without informed consent.

APEX: Automatic Event Sequence Generation for Android Applications,"Due to the event driven nature and the versatility of GUI designs in Android programs, it is challenging to generate event sequences with adequate code coverage within a reasonable time. A common approach to handle this issue is to rely on GUI models to generate event sequences. These sequences can be effective in covering GUI states, but inconsistent in exposing program behaviors that require specific inputs. A major obstacle to generate such specific inputs is the lack of a systematic GUI exploration process to accommodate the analysis requirements. In this paper, we introduce Android Path Explorer (APEX), a systematic input generation framework using concolic execution. APEX addresses the limitations of model-based sequence generation by using concolic execution to discover the data dependencies of GUI state transitions. Moreover, concolic execution is also used to prioritize events during the exploration of GUI, which leads to a more robust model and accurate input generation. The key novelty of APEX is that concolic execution is not only used to construct event sequences, but also used to traverse the GUI more systematically. As such, our experimental results show that APEX can be used to generate a set of event sequences that achieve high code coverage, as well as event sequences that reach specific targets.",2025-09-02 15:20:12+00:00,2025-09-02 15:20:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02412v1
A Survey: Towards Privacy and Security in Mobile Large Language Models,"Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs, systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy, federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks, membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.",2025-09-02 15:19:57+00:00,2025-09-02 15:19:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02411v1
Real-time ML-based Defense Against Malicious Payload in Reconfigurable Embedded Systems,"The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable integrated bitstream analysis.",2025-09-02 14:52:43+00:00,2025-09-02 14:52:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02387v1
Scam2Prompt: A Scalable Framework for Auditing Malicious Scam Endpoints in Production LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on uncurated web-scale datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To systematically evaluate this risk, we introduce Scam2Prompt, a scalable automated auditing framework that identifies the underlying intent of a scam site and then synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts that mirror this intent, allowing us to test whether an LLM will generate malicious code in response to these innocuous prompts. In a large-scale study of four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), we found that Scam2Prompt's innocuous prompts triggered malicious URL generation in 4.24% of cases. To test the persistence of this security risk, we constructed Innoc2Scam-bench, a benchmark of 1,559 innocuous prompts that consistently elicited malicious code from all four initial LLMs. When applied to seven additional production LLMs released in 2025, we found the vulnerability is not only present but severe, with malicious code generation rates ranging from 12.7% to 43.8%. Furthermore, existing safety measures like state-of-the-art guardrails proved insufficient to prevent this behavior, with an overall detection rate of less than 0.3%.",2025-10-02 20:58:03+00:00,2025-09-02 14:39:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02372v2
A Gentle Introduction to Blind signatures: From RSA to Lattice-based Cryptography,"Blind signatures were first introduced by David Chaum. They allow a user to have a message signed by a signer without revealing the message itself. This property is particularly useful in applications such as electronic voting and digital cash, where user anonymity is important. In a blind signature scheme, the user blinds their message before sending it to the signer, who signs the blinded message. The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid signature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace the signed message back to the original unblinded version. A good analogy is placing the message inside an envelope and having the envelope signed. Once the envelope is opened, the signature remains valid for the enclosed message, ensuring that the content remains confidential.   Such constructions provide anonymity and privacy to the user but given a practical quantum computer, the security of traditional crypto-systems providing such features will be broken. To address this, the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols is essential for maintaining the security of digital transactions and data. Aligning with the same goal, this work aims to thoroughly review the background of lattice-based blind signatures. We start with the foundations of digital signatures in the classical settings and then move on to lattice-based constructions.",2025-09-02 10:57:41+00:00,2025-09-02 10:57:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02189v1
Performance analysis of common browser extensions for cryptojacking detection,"This paper considers five extensions for Chromium-based browsers in order to determine how effective can browser-based defenses against cryptojacking available to regular users be. We've examined most popular extensions - MinerBlock, AdGuard AdBlocker, Easy Redirect && Prevent Cryptojacking, CoinEater and Miners Shield, which claim to be designed specifically to identify and stop illegal cryptocurrency mining. An empirically confirmed dataset of 373 distinct cryptojacking-infected websites which was assembled during multi-stage procedure, was used to test those extensions. The results showed that all plugins in question had significant performance limits. Easy Redirect and Miners Shield only blocked 6 and 5 websites respectively, while MinerBlock had the greatest detection rate at only 27% (101/373 sites blocked). Most concerningly, despite promises of cryptojacking prevention, AdGuard (which has over 13 million users) and CoinEater were unable to identify any of the compromised websites. These results demonstrate serious flaws in cryptojacking detection products targeted for regular users, since even the best-performing specimen failed to detect 73% of attacks. The obvious difference between advertised capabilities and real performance highlights the urgent need for either accessibility improvements for laboratory-grade detection technologies that show 90%+ efficiency in controlled environment or fundamental upgrades to current commonly used extensions.",2025-09-02 08:33:45+00:00,2025-09-02 08:33:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02083v1
From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach,"In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.",2025-09-03 18:14:56+00:00,2025-09-02 08:27:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077v2
Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation,"Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation and data utility remains a critical challenge.   To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in terms of sample quality and diversity.",2025-09-02 07:44:21+00:00,2025-09-02 07:44:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02048v1
Quantum Statistical Witness Indistinguishability,"Statistical witness indistinguishability is a relaxation of statistical zero-knowledge which guarantees that the transcript of an interactive proof reveals no information about which valid witness the prover used to generate it. In this paper we define and initiate the study of QSWI, the class of problems with quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs.   Using inherently quantum techniques from Kobayashi (TCC 2008), we prove that any problem with an honest-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof has a 3-message public-coin malicious-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof. There is no known analogue of this result for classical statistical witness indistinguishability. As a corollary, our result implies SWI is contained in QSWI.   Additionally, we extend the work of Bitansky et al. (STOC 2023) to show that quantum batch proofs imply quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs with inverse-polynomial witness indistinguishability error.",2025-09-02 04:33:09+00:00,2025-09-02 04:33:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01945v1
A software security review on Uganda's Mobile Money Services: Dr. Jim Spire's tweets sentiment analysis,"The proliferation of mobile money in Uganda has been a cornerstone of financial inclusion, yet its security mechanisms remain a critical concern.

Are Enterprises Ready for Quantum-Safe Cybersecurity?,"Quantum computing threatens to undermine classical cryptography by breaking widely deployed encryption and signature schemes. This paper examines enterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives: (i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view, analyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers; and (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the urgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC algorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings via a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Results indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC standards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\% of enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate ""harvest now, decrypt later"" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors have begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by costs, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave today's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing crypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC deployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A coordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future digital assets in the quantum era.",2025-09-01 19:27:06+00:00,2025-09-01 19:27:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01731v1
An intrusion detection system in internet of things using grasshopper optimization algorithm and machine learning algorithms,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.",2025-09-01 19:05:58+00:00,2025-09-01 19:05:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01724v1
Designing a Layered Framework to Secure Data via Improved Multi Stage Lightweight Cryptography in IoT Cloud Systems,"This paper presents a novel multi-layered hybrid security approach aimed at enhancing lightweight encryption for IoT-Cloud systems. The primary goal is to overcome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA, Blockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection, computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically refines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable and high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous environments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging technologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when effectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security architecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the H.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric, Enc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed, scalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer independently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and Auditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance across dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed solution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves execution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a robust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.",2025-09-01 18:53:20+00:00,2025-09-01 18:53:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01717v1
Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates,"AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.",2025-09-01 16:56:16+00:00,2025-09-01 16:56:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619v1
"Statistics-Friendly Confidentiality Protection for Establishment Data, with Applications to the QCEW","Confidentiality for business data is an understudied area of disclosure avoidance, where legacy methods struggle to provide acceptable results. Modern formal privacy techniques designed for person-level data do not provide suitable confidentiality/utility trade-offs due to the highly skewed nature of business data and because extreme outlier records are often important contributors to query answers. In this paper, inspired by Gaussian Differential Privacy, we propose a novel confidentiality framework for business data with a focus on interpretability for policy makers. We propose two query-answering mechanisms and analyze new challenges that arise when noisy query answers are converted into confidentiality-preserving microdata. We evaluate our mechanisms on confidential Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) microdata and a public substitute dataset.",2025-09-01 16:29:54+00:00,2025-09-01 16:29:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01597v1
GPS Spoofing Attacks and Pilot Responses Using a Flight Simulator Environment,"Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing involves transmitting fake signals that mimic those from GPS satellites, causing the GPS receivers to calculate incorrect Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information. Recently, there has been a surge in GPS spoofing attacks targeting aircraft. Since GPS satellite signals are weak, the spoofed high-power signal can easily overpower them. These spoofed signals are often interpreted as valid by the GPS receiver, which can cause severe and cascading effects on air navigation. While much of the existing research on GPS spoofing focuses on technical aspects of detection and mitigation, human factors are often neglected, even though pilots are an integral part of aircraft operation and potentially vulnerable to deception. This research addresses this gap by conducting a detailed analysis of the behavior of student pilots when subjected to GPS spoofing using the Force Dynamics 401CR flight simulator with X-Plane 11 and a Cessna 172 equipped with Garmin G1000. Spoofing scenarios were implemented via custom scripts that altered navigational data without modifying the external visual environment. Thirty student pilots from the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona Beach campus with diverse flying experience levels were recruited to participate in three spoofing scenarios. A pre-simulation questionnaire was distributed to measure pilot experience and confidence in GPS.Inflight decision-making during the spoofing attacks was observed, including reaction time to anomalies, visual attention to interface elements, and cognitive biases. A post-flight evaluation of workload was obtained using a modified NASA Task Load Index (TLX) method. This study provides a first step toward identifying human vulnerabilities to GPS spoofing amid the ongoing debate over GPS reliance.",2025-09-01 13:50:51+00:00,2025-09-01 13:50:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22662v1
Practical and Private Hybrid ML Inference with Fully Homomorphic Encryption,"In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs, but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the practicality of hybrid FHE inference.",2025-09-01 08:43:46+00:00,2025-09-01 08:43:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01253v1
Integrated Simulation Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on complex perception and communication systems, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. While simulation offers a scalable and safe environment for robustness testing, existing frameworks typically lack comprehensive supportfor modeling multi-domain adversarial scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, open-source integrated simulation framework designed to generate adversarial attacks targeting both perception and communication layers of AVs. The framework provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data, along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under realistic conditions.",2025-08-31 20:53:08+00:00,2025-08-31 20:53:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05332v1
ForensicsData: A Digital Forensics Dataset for Large Language Models,"The growing complexity of cyber incidents presents significant challenges for digital forensic investigators, especially in evidence collection and analysis. Public resources are still limited because of ethical, legal, and privacy concerns, even though realistic datasets are necessary to support research and tool developments. To address this gap, we introduce ForensicsData, an extensive Question-Context-Answer (Q-C-A) dataset sourced from actual malware analysis reports. It consists of more than 5,000 Q-C-A triplets. A unique workflow was used to create the dataset, which extracts structured data, uses large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance digital forensics by enabling reproducible experiments and fostering collaboration within the research community.",2025-08-31 19:58:24+00:00,2025-08-31 19:58:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05331v1
AI-Enhanced Intelligent NIDS Framework: Leveraging Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Attack Detection and Prevention,"In todays rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cloud Computing (CC), and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, decision trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18, while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent. accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via Downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing IDSs. in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks.",2025-09-09 09:02:42+00:00,2025-08-31 15:20:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00896v2
Adaptive t Design Dummy-Gate Obfuscation for Cryogenic Scale Enforcement,"Cloud quantum services can reveal circuit structure and timing through scheduler metadata, latency patterns, and co-tenant interference. We introduce NADGO (Noise-Adaptive Dummy-Gate Obfuscation), a scheduling and obfuscation stack that enforces operational privacy for gate-model workloads by applying per-interval limits on observable information leakage. To support confidentiality and fair multi-tenancy, operators require a method to audit compliance at acceptable overheads. NADGO combines: (i) hardware-aware t-design padding for structured cover traffic, (ii) particle-filter timing randomization to mask queue patterns, (iii) CASQUE subcircuit routing across heterogeneous backends, and (iv) a per-interval leakage estimator with locked calibration artifacts and a dual-threshold kill-switch. We prototype the approach on a 4-qubit superconducting tile with cryo-CMOS control and evaluate both depth-varied local-random circuits and small QAOA instances. Monitoring runs at a 6.3 microsecond control interval, and per-interval decisions are recorded in an append-only, hash-chained audit log. Across Monte Carlo (Tier 1) and cloud-hardware emulation (Tier 2) evaluations, NADGO maintains leakage within budget in nominal operation (interval-abort rate below 1 percent) and under attack yields high separation with concentrated aborts. At matched leakage targets, microbenchmarks indicate lower latency and cryogenic power consumption than static padding, while end-to-end workloads maintain competitive cost envelopes.",2025-08-31 12:12:48+00:00,2025-08-31 12:12:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00812v1
"MAESTROCUT: Dynamic, Noise-Adaptive, and Secure Quantum Circuit Cutting on Near-Term Hardware","We present MaestroCut, a closed-loop framework for quantum circuit cutting that adapts partitioning and shot allocation to device drift and workload variation. MaestroCut tracks a variance proxy in real time, triggers re-cutting when accuracy degrades, and routes shots using topology-aware priors. An online estimator cascade (MLE, Bayesian, GP-assisted) selects the lowest-error reconstruction within a fixed budget. Tier-1 simulations show consistent variance contraction and reduced mean-squared error versus uniform and proportional baselines. Tier-2 emulation with realistic queueing and noise demonstrates stable latency targets, high reliability, and ~1% software overhead under stress scenarios. These results indicate that adaptive circuit cutting can provide accuracy and efficiency improvements with minimal operational cost on near-term hardware.",2025-08-31 12:01:16+00:00,2025-08-31 12:01:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00811v1
Secure and Scalable Face Retrieval via Cancelable Product Quantization,"Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.",2025-08-31 10:19:55+00:00,2025-08-31 10:19:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00781v1
Bayesian and Multi-Objective Decision Support for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Incident Mitigation,"This research proposes a real-time, adaptive decision-support framework for mitigating cyber incidents in cyber-physical systems, developed in response to an increasing reliance on these systems within critical infrastructure and evolving adversarial tactics. Existing decision-support systems often fall short in accounting for multi-agent, multi-path attacks and trade-offs between safety and operational continuity. To address this, our framework integrates hierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, constructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability data. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance computational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a hybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit Prediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via Bayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by incomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations are generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood, impact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and resource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied to prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework was evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios, demonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under real-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational contexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse threat environments.",2025-08-31 09:47:38+00:00,2025-08-31 09:47:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00770v1
"Virtual Reality, Real Problems: A Longitudinal Security Analysis of VR Firmware","Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly growing in recent years. VR devices such as Meta Quest 3 utilize numerous sensors to collect users' data to provide an immersive experience. Due to the extensive data collection and the immersive nature, the security of VR devices is paramount. Leading VR devices often adopt and customize Android systems, which makes them susceptible to both Android-based vulnerabilities and new issues introduced by VR-specific customizations (e.g., system services to support continuous head and hand tracking). While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of the Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of VR firmware. We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two major vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the kernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer. We have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including missing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening, inconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve security and trust for VR devices. This paper will act as an important security resource for VR developers, users, and vendors, and will also direct future advancements in secure VR ecosystem.",2025-09-07 17:10:40+00:00,2025-08-31 02:16:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00662v2
AMCR: A Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks in Generative Models,"Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks, significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms, ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis, and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks, offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of generative models.",2025-08-31 00:00:03+00:00,2025-08-31 00:00:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00641v1
Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for Mitigating Byzantine Threats,"Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.   To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead.",2025-08-30 23:36:22+00:00,2025-08-30 23:36:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00634v1
Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Sublinear Space,"Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification of computations without revealing private information. However, existing systems require memory proportional to the computation size, which has historically limited use in large-scale applications and on mobile and edge devices. We solve this fundamental bottleneck by developing, to our knowledge, the first proof system with sublinear memory requirements for mainstream cryptographic constructions. Our approach processes computations in blocks using a space-efficient tree algorithm, reducing memory from linear scaling to square-root scaling--from $Θ(T)$ to $O(\sqrt{T} + \log T \log\log T)$ for computation size $T$--while maintaining the same proof generation time through a constant number of streaming passes. For widely-used linear polynomial commitment schemes (KZG/IPA), our method produces identical proofs and verification when using the same parameters and hashing only aggregate commitments into the challenge generation, preserving proof size and security. Hash-based systems also achieve square-root memory scaling though with slightly different proof structures. This advance enables zero-knowledge proofs on everyday devices and makes previously infeasible large computations verifiable, fundamentally democratizing access to privacy-preserving computation. Space-efficient zero knowledge proof systems create opportunities to reshape how trust is established in digital systems--from enabling widespread participation in decentralized networks to making verifiable scientific computing practical at unprecedented scales.",2025-09-17 17:25:28+00:00,2025-08-30 23:22:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05326v2
FreeTalk:A plug-and-play and black-box defense against speech synthesis attacks,"Recently, speech assistant and speech verification have been used in many fields, which brings much benefit and convenience for us. However, when we enjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for speech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate political opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a piece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's reputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice conversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further reduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and privacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving methods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks: low transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These deficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, plug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a black-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain perturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high speech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise smoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides, to reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise protection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker and support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification models, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has satisfying privacy-preserving performance, high speech quality, and utility.",2025-08-30 17:10:22+00:00,2025-08-30 17:10:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00561v1
FedThief: Harming Others to Benefit Oneself in Self-Centered Federated Learning,"In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where ""divergence"" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global model.",2025-08-30 15:42:39+00:00,2025-08-30 15:42:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00540v1
Cross-Domain Malware Detection via Probability-Level Fusion of Lightweight Gradient Boosting Models,"The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided for full reproducibility.",2025-08-30 12:18:13+00:00,2025-08-30 12:18:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00476v1
Privacy-Preserving Offloading for Large Language Models in 6G Vehicular Networks,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems. However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for resource-constrained vehicular environments.",2025-08-30 10:08:28+00:00,2025-08-30 10:08:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05320v1
A Hybrid AI-based and Rule-based Approach to DICOM De-identification: A Solution for the MIDI-B Challenge,"Ensuring the de-identification of medical imaging data is a critical step in enabling safe data sharing. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework designed to process Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Our framework adopts a modified, pre-built rule-based component, updated with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)'s best practices guidelines, as outlined in DICOM PS 3.15, for improved performance. It incorporates PaddleOCR, a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for extracting text from images, and RoBERTa, a fine-tuned transformer-based model for identifying and removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). Initially, the transformer-based model and the rule-based component were integrated to process for both structured data and free text. However, this coarse-grained approach did not yield optimal results. To improve performance, we refined our approach by applying the transformer model exclusively to free text, while structured data was handled only by rule-based methods. In this framework the DICOM validator dciodvfy was leveraged to ensure the integrity of DICOM files after the deID process. Through iterative refinement, including the incorporation of custom rules and private tag handling, the framework achieved a de-identification accuracy of 99.91% on the MIDI-B test dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining rule-based compliance with AI-enabled adaptability in addressing the complex challenges of DICOM de-identification.",2025-08-30 09:52:15+00:00,2025-08-30 09:52:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00437v1
The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models,"Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.",2025-08-30 07:04:29+00:00,2025-08-30 07:04:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391v1
ShadowScope: GPU Monitoring and Validation via Composable Side Channel Signals,"As modern systems increasingly rely on GPUs for computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning acceleration, ensuring the integrity of GPU computation has become critically important. Recent studies have shown that GPU kernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer attacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable through side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation approaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to interference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse scheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a monitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model. Instead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes trusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key behavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at finer granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise, workload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce reliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a hardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip checks into the GPU pipeline. ShadowScope+ achieves high validation accuracy with an average runtime overhead of just 4.6%, while incurring minimal hardware and design complexity. Together, these contributions demonstrate that side-channel observability can be systematically repurposed into a practical defense for GPU kernel integrity.",2025-09-03 20:21:21+00:00,2025-08-30 01:38:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00300v2
OptMark: Robust Multi-bit Diffusion Watermarking via Inference Time Optimization,"Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods, reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations, editing, and regeneration attacks.",2025-08-29 15:50:59+00:00,2025-08-29 15:50:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21727v1
Cybersecurity AI: Hacking the AI Hackers via Prompt Injection,"We demonstrate how AI-powered cybersecurity tools can be turned against themselves through prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection is reminiscent of cross-site scripting (XSS): malicious text is hidden within seemingly trusted content, and when the system processes it, that text is transformed into unintended instructions. When AI agents designed to find and exploit vulnerabilities interact with malicious web servers, carefully crafted reponses can hijack their execution flow, potentially granting attackers system access. We present proof-of-concept exploits against the Cybersecurity AI (CAI) framework and its CLI tool, and detail our mitigations against such attacks in a multi-layered defense implementation. Our findings indicate that prompt injection is a recurring and systemic issue in LLM-based architectures, one that will require dedicated work to address, much as the security community has had to do with XSS in traditional web applications.",2025-11-15 20:20:01+00:00,2025-08-29 14:32:48+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21669v2
Analogy between Learning With Error Problem and Ill-Posed Inverse Problems,"In this work, we unveil an analogy between well-known lattice based learning with error problem and ill-posed inverse problems. We show that LWE problem is a structured inverse problem. Further, we propose a symmetric encryption scheme based on ill-posed problems and thoroughly discuss its security. Finally, we propose a public key encryption scheme based on our symmetric encryption scheme and CRYSTALS-Kyber KEM (key encapsulation mechanism) and discuss its security.",2025-08-29 14:15:49+00:00,2025-08-29 14:15:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21653v1
Hybrid Cryptographic Monitoring System for Side-Channel Attack Detection on PYNQ SoCs,"AES-128 encryption is theoretically secure but vulnerable in practical deployments due to timing and fault injection attacks on embedded systems. This work presents a lightweight dual-detection framework combining statistical thresholding and machine learning (ML) for real-time anomaly detection. By simulating anomalies via delays and ciphertext corruption, we collect timing and data features to evaluate two strategies: (1) a statistical threshold method based on execution time and (2) a Random Forest classifier trained on block-level anomalies. Implemented on CPU and FPGA (PYNQ-Z1), our results show that the ML approach outperforms static thresholds in accuracy, while maintaining real-time feasibility on embedded platforms. The framework operates without modifying AES internals or relying on hardware performance counters. This makes it especially suitable for low-power, resource-constrained systems where detection accuracy and computational efficiency must be balanced.",2025-08-29 13:13:43+00:00,2025-08-29 13:13:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21606v1
RepoMark: A Data-Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models,"The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency.   However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection.   To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables auditors to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect model behavior difference on trained data. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances data efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files.   Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of code authors.",2025-11-03 02:58:46+00:00,2025-08-29 09:01:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v3
AegisShield: Democratizing Cyber Threat Modeling with Generative AI,"The increasing sophistication of technology systems makes traditional threat modeling hard to scale, especially for small organizations with limited resources. This paper develops and evaluates AegisShield, a generative AI enhanced threat modeling tool that implements STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK to automate threat generation and provide systematic assessments. By integrating real time threat intelligence from the National Vulnerability Database and AlienVault Open Threat Exchange, AegisShield produces streamlined and accessible threat descriptions. Our assessment of 243 threats from 15 case studies and over 8000 AI generated threats shows that AegisShield reduces complexity (p less than 0.001), yields outputs semantically aligned with expert developed threats (p less than 0.05), and achieves an 85.4 percent success rate in mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (p less than 0.001). Automating and standardizing threat modeling helps under resourced organizations address risk earlier and supports wider adoption of secure by design practices.",2025-08-29 03:49:15+00:00,2025-08-29 03:49:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10482v1
Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing,"Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs.   We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.",2025-09-03 03:33:23+00:00,2025-08-29 01:47:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2
Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation,"Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic formulation that casts lateral movement as a path-closure problem over a probability semiring to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $π(s)$ for each service, with step successes composed via a probabilistic path operator \( \otimes \) and alternative paths aggregated via a probabilistic union \( \oplus \) (noisy-OR). This yields a monotone fixed-point (iterative) computation of a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive services (SSH 22, RDP 3389) receive higher $π(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$π(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral-movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.",2025-11-07 17:29:36+00:00,2025-08-28 17:07:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005v2
Guarding Against Malicious Biased Threats (GAMBiT) Experiments: Revealing Cognitive Bias in Human-Subjects Red-Team Cyber Range Operations,"We present three large-scale human-subjects red-team cyber range datasets from the Guarding Against Malicious Biased Threats (GAMBiT) project. Across Experiments 1-3 (July 2024-March 2025), 19-20 skilled attackers per experiment conducted two 8-hour days of self-paced operations in a simulated enterprise network (SimSpace Cyber Force Platform) while we captured multi-modal data: self-reports (background, demographics, psychometrics), operational notes, terminal histories, keylogs, network packet captures (PCAP), and NIDS alerts (Suricata). Each participant began from a standardized Kali Linux VM and pursued realistic objectives (e.g., target discovery and data exfiltration) under controlled constraints. Derivative curated logs and labels are included. The combined release supports research on attacker behavior modeling, bias-aware analytics, and method benchmarking. Data are available via IEEE Dataport entries for Experiments 1-3.",2025-08-28 16:20:09+00:00,2025-08-28 16:20:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20963v1
PromptSleuth: Detecting Prompt Injection via Semantic Intent Invariance,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, from virtual assistants to autonomous agents. However, their flexibility also introduces new attack vectors-particularly Prompt Injection (PI), where adversaries manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs. As attackers continuously evolve with paraphrased, obfuscated, and even multi-task injection strategies, existing benchmarks are no longer sufficient to capture the full spectrum of emerging threats.   To address this gap, we construct a new benchmark that systematically extends prior efforts. Our benchmark subsumes the two widely-used existing ones while introducing new manipulation techniques and multi-task scenarios, thereby providing a more comprehensive evaluation setting. We find that existing defenses, though effective on their original benchmarks, show clear weaknesses under our benchmark, underscoring the need for more robust solutions. Our key insight is that while attack forms may vary, the adversary's intent-injecting an unauthorized task-remains invariant. Building on this observation, we propose PromptSleuth, a semantic-oriented defense framework that detects prompt injection by reasoning over task-level intent rather than surface features. Evaluated across state-of-the-art benchmarks, PromptSleuth consistently outperforms existing defense while maintaining comparable runtime and cost efficiency. These results demonstrate that intent-based semantic reasoning offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable strategy for defending LLMs against evolving prompt injection threats.",2025-09-16 01:18:20+00:00,2025-08-28 15:19:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20890v2
AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning,"The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated vulnerability detection and repair systems. Data-driven approaches using deep learning models show promise but critically depend on the availability of large, accurately labeled datasets. Yet existing datasets either suffer from noisy labels, limited range of vulnerabilities, or fail to reflect vulnerabilities as they occur in real-world software. This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to directly address these dataset limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success rates. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection workflow. It automatically injects realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities for high-fidelity, diverse, large-scale vulnerability dataset generation. Unlike prior monolithic approaches, AVIATOR orchestrates specialized AI agents, function agents and traditional code analysis tools that replicate expert reasoning. It combines semantic analysis, injection synthesis enhanced with LoRA-based fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as well as post-injection validation via static analysis and LLM-based discriminators. This modular decomposition allows specialized agents to focus on distinct tasks, improving robustness of injection and reducing error propagation across the workflow. Evaluations across three distinct benchmarks demonstrate that AVIATOR achieves 91%-95% injection success rates, significantly surpassing existing automated dataset generation techniques in both accuracy and scope of software vulnerabilities.",2025-11-06 21:24:36+00:00,2025-08-28 14:59:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20866v3
Publish to Perish: Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Assisted Peer Review,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into the scientific peer-review process, raising new questions about their reliability and resilience to manipulation. In this work, we investigate the potential for hidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations -- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that adversely affect a ""honest-but-lazy"" reviewer. Finally, we propose and empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under automated content checks.",2025-08-29 09:37:59+00:00,2025-08-28 14:57:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20863v2
Multi-Agent Penetration Testing AI for the Web,"AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the capacity for thorough security assessment.   We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%) and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.   MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10 findings are under CVE review.",2025-08-28 14:14:24+00:00,2025-08-28 14:14:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20816v1
Microarchitecture Design and Benchmarking of Custom SHA-3 Instruction for RISC-V,"Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements. However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations, often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3 permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization, and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5 simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09% increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations for future cryptographic instruction set extensions.",2025-08-28 10:57:13+00:00,2025-08-28 10:57:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20653v1
Bitcoin as an Interplanetary Monetary Standard with Proof-of-Transit Timestamping,"We explore the feasibility of deploying Bitcoin as the shared monetary standard between Earth and Mars, accounting for physical constraints of interplanetary communication. We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit Timestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for Bitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO) mesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication, long-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure settlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit chains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it measurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin consensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations for local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted) provide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while Mars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged assets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon regimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to administrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring.",2025-08-28 09:28:11+00:00,2025-08-28 09:28:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20591v1
Evaluating Differentially Private Generation of Domain-Specific Text,"Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets, revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their evaluation in realistic scenarios.",2025-08-28 05:57:47+00:00,2025-08-28 05:57:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20452v1
Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.",2025-08-28 04:46:44+00:00,2025-08-28 04:46:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20424v1
"MindGuard: Tracking, Detecting, and Attributing MCP Tool Poisoning Attack via Decision Dependence Graph","The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor.   Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.",2025-08-28 04:23:44+00:00,2025-08-28 04:23:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412v1
Surveying the Operational Cybersecurity and Supply Chain Threat Landscape when Developing and Deploying AI Systems,"The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.",2025-08-27 22:46:23+00:00,2025-08-27 22:46:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20307v1
Network-Level Prompt and Trait Leakage in Local Research Agents,"We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be deployed locally by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit $70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique fingerprinting attacks.   Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over 73% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing attack effectiveness by an average of 29%.",2025-09-03 03:33:59+00:00,2025-08-27 21:24:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282v2
Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model,"Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute significant security threats to decentralized applications, leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. By combining the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.8633 on an evaluation set of 10,000 real-world smart contracts across ten distinct intent categories.   In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for intent detection. On the same evaluation set of 10,000 smart contracts, SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also delivers a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as a new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.",2025-10-03 14:43:31+00:00,2025-08-27 17:54:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v3
AEGIS : Automated Co-Evolutionary Framework for Guarding Prompt Injections Schema,"Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO) module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.",2025-10-09 04:58:46+00:00,2025-08-27 12:25:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00088v2
Every Keystroke You Make: A Tech-Law Measurement and Analysis of Event Listeners for Wiretapping,"The privacy community has a long track record of investigating emerging types of web tracking techniques. Recent work has focused on compliance of web trackers with new privacy laws such as Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA. Despite the growing body of research documenting widespread lack of compliance with new privacy laws, there is a lack of robust enforcement. Different from prior work, we conduct a tech-law analysis to map decades-old U.S. laws about interception of electronic communications--so-called wiretapping--to web tracking. Bridging the tech-law gap for older wiretapping laws is important and timely because, in cases where legal harm to privacy is proven, they can provide statutory private right of action, are at the forefront of recent privacy enforcement, and could ultimately lead to a meaningful change in the web tracking landscape.   In this paper, we focus on a particularly invasive tracking technique: the use of JavaScript event listeners by third-party trackers for real-time keystroke interception on websites. We use an instrumented web browser to crawl a sample of the top-million websites to investigate the use of event listeners that aligns with the criteria for wiretapping, according to U.S. wiretapping law at the federal level and in California. We find evidence that 38.52% websites installed third-party event listeners to intercept keystrokes, and that at least 3.18% websites transmitted intercepted information to a third-party server, which aligns with the criteria for wiretapping. We further find evidence that the intercepted information such as email addresses typed into form fields are used for unsolicited email marketing. Beyond our work that maps the intersection between technical measurement and U.S. wiretapping law, additional future legal research is required to determine when the wiretapping observed in our paper passes the threshold for illegality.",2025-08-27 12:20:52+00:00,2025-08-27 12:20:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19825v1
From Research to Reality: Feasibility of Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning,"Gradient inversion attacks have garnered attention for their ability to compromise privacy in federated learning. However, many studies consider attacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like dropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In this work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior affect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode clients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack feasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in standard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are only possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously: models must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ pre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in training-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by presenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here, to enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference mode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model vulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong inherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering the first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of architectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy. Our analysis provides actionable insight into when models are likely vulnerable, when they appear robust, and where subtle leakage may persist.

The Art of Hide and Seek: Making Pickle-Based Model Supply Chain Poisoning Stealthy Again,"Pickle deserialization vulnerabilities have persisted throughout Python's history, remaining widely recognized yet unresolved. Due to its ability to transparently save and restore complex objects into byte streams, many AI/ML frameworks continue to adopt pickle as the model serialization protocol despite its inherent risks. As the open-source model ecosystem grows, model-sharing platforms such as Hugging Face have attracted massive participation, significantly amplifying the real-world risks of pickle exploitation and opening new avenues for model supply chain poisoning. Although several state-of-the-art scanners have been developed to detect poisoned models, their incomplete understanding of the poisoning surface leaves the detection logic fragile and allows attackers to bypass them. In this work, we present the first systematic disclosure of the pickle-based model poisoning surface from both model loading and risky function perspectives. Our research demonstrates how pickle-based model poisoning can remain stealthy and highlights critical gaps in current scanning solutions. On the model loading surface, we identify 22 distinct pickle-based model loading paths across five foundational AI/ML frameworks, 19 of which are entirely missed by existing scanners. We further develop a bypass technique named Exception-Oriented Programming (EOP) and discover 9 EOP instances, 7 of which can bypass all scanners. On the risky function surface, we discover 133 exploitable gadgets, achieving almost a 100% bypass rate. Even against the best-performing scanner, these gadgets maintain an 89% bypass rate. By systematically revealing the pickle-based model poisoning surface, we achieve practical and robust bypasses against real-world scanners. We responsibly disclose our findings to corresponding vendors, receiving acknowledgments and a $6000 bug bounty.",2025-08-27 10:59:34+00:00,2025-08-27 10:59:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19774v1
Addressing Deepfake Issue in Selfie banking through camera based authentication,"Fake images in selfie banking are increasingly becoming a threat.

Mind the Third Eye! Benchmarking Privacy Awareness in MLLM-powered Smartphone Agents,"Smartphones bring significant convenience to users but also enable devices to extensively record various types of personal information. Existing smartphone agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in automating different tasks. However, as the cost, these agents are granted substantial access to sensitive users' personal information during this operation. To gain a thorough understanding of the privacy awareness of these agents, we present the first large-scale benchmark encompassing 7,138 scenarios to the best of our knowledge. In addition, for privacy context in scenarios, we annotate its type (e.g., Account Credentials), sensitivity level, and location. We then carefully benchmark seven available mainstream smartphone agents. Our results demonstrate that almost all benchmarked agents show unsatisfying privacy awareness (RA), with performance remaining below 60% even with explicit hints. Overall, closed-source agents show better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash achieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%. We also find that the agents' privacy detection capability is highly related to scenario sensitivity level, i.e., the scenario with a higher sensitivity level is typically more identifiable. We hope the findings enlighten the research community to rethink the unbalanced utility-privacy tradeoff about smartphone agents. Our code and benchmark are available at https://zhixin-l.github.io/SAPA-Bench.",2025-09-03 07:48:34+00:00,2025-08-27 00:41:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19493v2
PoolFlip: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Security Environment for Cyber Defense,"Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy, deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym environment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for attackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training to train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown, potentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO defenders are $2\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a heuristic attack not exposed in training. In addition, our newly designed ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain a high level of control while optimizing performance.",2025-08-27 00:18:49+00:00,2025-08-27 00:18:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19488v1
SIExVulTS: Sensitive Information Exposure Vulnerability Detection System using Transformer Models and Static Analysis,"Sensitive Information Exposure (SIEx) vulnerabilities (CWE-200) remain a persistent and under-addressed threat across software systems, often leading to serious security breaches. Existing detection tools rarely target the diverse subcategories of CWE-200 or provide context-aware analysis of code-level data flows.   Aims: This paper aims to present SIExVulTS, a novel vulnerability detection system that integrates transformer-based models with static analysis to identify and verify sensitive information exposure in Java applications.   Method: SIExVulTS employs a three-stage architecture: (1) an Attack Surface Detection Engine that uses sentence embeddings to identify sensitive variables, strings, comments, and sinks; (2) an Exposure Analysis Engine that instantiates CodeQL queries aligned with the CWE-200 hierarchy; and (3) a Flow Verification Engine that leverages GraphCodeBERT to semantically validate source-to-sink flows. We evaluate SIExVulTS using three curated datasets, including real-world CVEs, a benchmark set of synthetic CWE-200 examples, and labeled flows from 31 open-source projects.   Results: The Attack Surface Detection Engine achieved an average F1 score greater than 93\%, the Exposure Analysis Engine achieved an F1 score of 85.71\%, and the Flow Verification Engine increased precision from 22.61\% to 87.23\%. Moreover, SIExVulTS successfully uncovered six previously unknown CVEs in major Apache projects.   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that SIExVulTS is effective and practical for improving software security against sensitive data exposure, addressing limitations of existing tools in detecting and verifying CWE-200 vulnerabilities.",2025-08-26 23:23:35+00:00,2025-08-26 23:23:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19472v1
Enabling Transparent Cyber Threat Intelligence Combining Large Language Models and Domain Ontologies,"Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs. However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data, which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction quality rather than processing speed.",2025-08-26 23:17:33+00:00,2025-08-26 23:17:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00081v1
The Sample Complexity of Membership Inference and Privacy Auditing,"A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a target individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member of the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A successful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have some knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from, and this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference samples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the attacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample complexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful attack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean estimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(μ,Σ)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate $\hatμ$ up to some error $\mathbb{E}[\|\hat μ- μ\|^2_Σ]\leq ρ^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting, $Ω(n + n^2 ρ^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that competes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that the attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses to train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as all attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples and cannot benefit from $ω(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be underestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may be possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.",2025-08-26 22:19:28+00:00,2025-08-26 22:19:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19458v1
A NIS2 pan-European registry for identifying and classifying essential and important entities,"The NIS2 Directive establishes a common cybersecurity governance model across the European Union, requiring member states to identify, classify, and supervise essential and important entities. As part of a broader governance network, member states are also obligated to notify the European Commission, the Cooperation Group, and ENISA about their cybersecurity infrastructure landscape. This thesis presents an analysis of the NIS2 Directive in this context and translates its provisions into concrete technical requirements. These requirements inform the design and implementation of a modular, legally grounded registry system intended to support competent authorities across the EU in meeting their obligations. Using the Design Science Research methodology, the thesis transforms complex legal provisions into structured workflows, deterministic classification algorithms, and interactive dashboards. The resulting system automates key regulatory processes, including entity registration, classification, and notification, while enabling context-aware supervision and reducing administrative burden. It supports both automated and manual registration methods and introduces a contextual labeling system to handle edge cases, risk factors, and cross-directive dependencies. Although developed for the Norwegian regulatory ecosystem, the system is designed for adaptation by other member states with minimal modification. This thesis contributes a reusable framework that bridges legal interpretation and technical implementation, offering a scalable solution for national and EU-level NIS2 cybersecurity governance. It also identifies key limitations and outlines opportunities for future research and development.",2025-08-26 19:40:33+00:00,2025-08-26 19:40:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19395v1
Towards Quantum Machine Learning for Malicious Code Analysis,"Classical machine learning (CML) has been extensively studied for malware classification. With the emergence of quantum computing, quantum machine learning (QML) presents a paradigm-shifting opportunity to improve malware detection, though its application in this domain remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate two hybrid quantum-classical models -- a Quantum Multilayer Perceptron (QMLP) and a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), for malware classification. Both models utilize angle embedding to encode malware features into quantum states. QMLP captures complex patterns through full qubit measurement and data re-uploading, while QCNN achieves faster training via quantum convolution and pooling layers that reduce active qubits. We evaluate both models on five widely used malware datasets -- API-Graph, EMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, and AZ-Class, across binary and multiclass classification tasks.   Our results show high accuracy for binary classification -- 95-96% on API-Graph, 91-92% on AZ-Domain, and 77% on EMBER-Domain. In multiclass settings, accuracy ranges from 91.6-95.7% on API-Graph, 41.7-93.6% on AZ-Class, and 60.7-88.1% on EMBER-Class. Overall, QMLP outperforms QCNN in complex multiclass tasks, while QCNN offers improved training efficiency at the cost of reduced accuracy.",2025-08-26 19:20:21+00:00,2025-08-26 19:20:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19381v1
Just Dork and Crawl: Measuring Illegal Online Gambling Defacement in Indonesian Websites,"This study investigates the defacement of Indonesian websites by actors promoting illegal online gambling. Using a lightweight methodology that combines keyword-driven dorking with systematic crawling, we identified 453 defaced webpages within one month. Although dorking alone yielded a false positive rate of approximately 20.3\%, the integration of crawling and keyword-counting enabled reliable differentiation between true and false positives. Our measurements revealed diverse defacement behaviors, including repeat defacements (150 cases), fixed instances (129), keyword modifications (55), and redirections or hidden URL injections. In total, 8,837 unique third-party URLs spanning 5,930 domains were captured, with a small subset recurring across multiple sites. Website responses were inconsistent, with an average reaction time of 75.3 hours. These findings demonstrate that simple, reproducible techniques can provide meaningful insights into the scale, persistence, and dynamics of defacement, highlighting the importance of continuous measurement for strengthening defenses against online gambling activities.",2025-08-26 19:01:12+00:00,2025-08-26 19:01:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19368v1
An Efficient Lightweight Blockchain for Decentralized IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is applied in various fields, and the number of physical devices connected to the IoT is increasingly growing. There are significant challenges to the IoT's growth and development, mainly due to the centralized nature and large-scale IoT networks. The emphasis on the decentralization of IoT's architecture can overcome challenges to IoT's capabilities. A promising decentralized platform for IoT is blockchain. Owing to IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW and PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive. Therefore, the PoA consensus algorithm is proposed in the blockchain consensus network for IoT. The PoA selects the validator as Turn-based selection (TBS) that needs optimization and faces system reliability, energy consumption, latency, and low scalability. We propose an efficient, lightweight blockchain for decentralizing IoT architecture by using virtualization and clustering to increase productivity and scalability to address these issues. We also introduce a novel PoA based on the Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method for validators to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. By simulation, we evaluated the performance of our proposed WBS method as opposed to TBS. The results show reduced energy consumption, and response time, and increased throughput.",2025-08-26 17:36:45+00:00,2025-08-26 17:36:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19219v1

mmKey: Channel-Aware Beam Shaping for Reliable Key Generation in mmWave Wireless Networks,"Physical-layer key generation (PLKG) has emerged as a promising technique to secure next-generation wireless networks by exploiting the inherent properties of the wireless channel. However, PLKG faces fundamental challenges in the millimeter wave (mmWave) regime due to channel sparsity, higher phase noise, and higher path loss, which undermine both the randomness and reciprocity required for secure key generation. In this paper, we present mmKey, a novel PLKG framework that capitalizes on the availability of multiple antennas at mmWave wireless nodes to inject randomness into an otherwise quasi-static wireless channel. Different from prior works that sacrifice either the secrecy of the key generation or the robustness, mmKey balances these two requirements. In particular, mmKey leverages a genetic algorithm to gradually evolve the initial weight vector population toward configurations that suppress the LOS component while taking into account the channel conditions, specifically, the sparsity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Extensive simulations show that mmKey improves the secrecy gap by an average of 39.4% over random beamforming and 34.0% over null beamforming, outperforming conventional schemes.",2025-08-26 13:14:35+00:00,2025-08-26 13:14:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19010v1
The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization,"Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts. We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels. Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy protection by thinking adversarially.",2025-08-26 12:22:45+00:00,2025-08-26 12:22:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18976v1
Quantum computing on encrypted data with arbitrary rotation gates,"An efficient technique of computing on encrypted data allows a client with limited capability to perform complex operations on a remote fault-tolerant server without leaking anything about the input or output. Quantum computing provides information-theoretic security to solve such a problem, and many such techniques have been proposed under the premises of half-blind quantum computation. However, they are dependent on a fixed non-parametric resource set that comprises some universal combination of $H,S,T,CX, CZ$ or $CCX$ gates. In this study, we show that recursive decryption of the parametric gate, $R_z(θ)$, is possible exactly when $θ=\pmπ/2^m$ for $m\in \mathbb{Z^{+}}$, and approximately with arbitrary precision $ε$ for given $θ$. We also show that a blind algorithm based on such a technique needs at most $O(\log_2^2(π/ε))$ computation steps and communication rounds, while the techniques based on a non-parametric resource set require $O(\ln^{3.97}(1/ε))$ rounds. We use these results to propose a universal scheme of half-blind quantum computation for computing on encrypted data using arbitrary rotation gates. This substantial reduction in the depth of blind circuit is an affirmative step towards the practical application of such techniques in secure NISQ-era computing.",2025-09-24 14:42:25+00:00,2025-08-26 08:41:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18811v2
Hidden Tail: Adversarial Image Causing Stealthy Resource Consumption in Vision-Language Models,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However, these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content, compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users. Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Hidden_Tail.",2025-08-26 08:40:22+00:00,2025-08-26 08:40:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18805v1
Leveraging 3D Technologies for Hardware Security: Opportunities and Challenges,"3D die stacking and 2.5D interposer design are promising technologies to improve integration density, performance and cost. Current approaches face serious issues in dealing with emerging security challenges such as side channel attacks, hardware trojans, secure IC manufacturing and IP piracy. By utilizing intrinsic characteristics of 2.5D and 3D technologies, we propose novel opportunities in designing secure systems.

A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs,"Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.   This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

$AutoGuardX$: A Comprehensive Cybersecurity Framework for Connected Vehicles,"The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected systems in modern vehicles not only introduced a new era of convenience, automation, and connected vehicles but also elevated their exposure to sophisticated cyber threats. This is especially evident in US and Canada, where cyber-enabled auto theft has surged in recent years, revealing the limitations of existing security measures for connected vehicles. In response, this paper proposes $AutoGuardX$, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for connected vehicles. $AutoGuardX$ combines key elements from existing recognized standards for vehicle security, such as ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 26262, with advanced technologies, including machine learning-based anomaly detection, IoT security protocols, and encrypted communication channels. The framework addresses major attack vectors like relay attacks, controller area network (CAN) bus intrusions, and vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies such as 5G and quantum computing. $AutoGuardX$ is extensively evaluated through security simulations across a mix of Sedans and SUVs from four major vehicle brands manufactured between 2019 and 2023.

Learning from Few Samples: A Novel Approach for High-Quality Malcode Generation,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework \textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios. Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1) the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2) the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber threats.",2025-08-25 15:55:17+00:00,2025-08-25 15:55:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18148v1
MalLoc: Toward Fine-grained Android Malicious Payload Localization via LLMs,"The rapid evolution of Android malware poses significant challenges to the maintenance and security of mobile applications (apps). Traditional detection techniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that employ advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior triggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise understanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design of effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps vulnerable to continuously evolving threats.   To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision and interpretability in malware analysis. This work advances beyond traditional detection and classification by enabling deeper insights into behavior-level malicious logic and opens new directions for research, including dynamic modeling of localized threats and targeted countermeasure development.",2025-08-25 10:05:44+00:00,2025-08-25 10:05:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17856v1
ClearMask: Noise-Free and Naturalness-Preserving Protection Against Voice Deepfake Attacks,"Voice deepfake attacks, which artificially impersonate human speech for malicious purposes, have emerged as a severe threat. Existing defenses typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To overcome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches, ClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect streaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and LiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models and black-box API services.

RL-Finetuned LLMs for Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Rewriting,"The performance of modern machine learning systems depends on access to large, high-quality datasets, often sourced from user-generated content or proprietary, domain-specific corpora. However, these rich datasets inherently contain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about privacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While conventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such removal may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks. More importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference attacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or demographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards during model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user privacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that jointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the privacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a minimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these privacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed approach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility while mitigating privacy risks. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading semantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy preserving data generation in the era of large language models.",2025-08-25 04:38:19+00:00,2025-08-25 04:38:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19286v1
Cyber Security Educational Games for Children: A Systematic Literature Review,"Educational games have been widely used to teach children about cyber security. This systematic literature review reveals evidence of positive learning outcomes, after analysing 91 such games reported in 68 papers published between 2010 and 2024. However, critical gaps have also been identified regarding the design processes and the methodological rigour, including lack of systematic design, misalignment between proposed and achieved learning outcomes, rare use of control groups, limited discussions on ethical considerations, and underutilisation of emerging technologies. We recommend multiple future research directions, e.g., a hybrid approach to game design and evaluation that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches.",2025-08-24 15:39:54+00:00,2025-08-24 15:39:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17414v1
"Trust Me, I Know This Function: Hijacking LLM Static Analysis using Bias","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).   We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective, but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.",2025-08-24 13:42:48+00:00,2025-08-24 13:42:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17361v1
A Comprehensive Review of Denial of Wallet Attacks in Serverless Architectures,"The Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack poses a unique and growing threat to serverless architectures that rely on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) models, exploiting the cost structure of pay-as-you-go billing to financially burden application owners. Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.",2025-08-24 13:29:21+00:00,2025-08-24 13:29:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19284v1
Rethinking Denial-of-Service: A Conditional Taxonomy Unifying Availability and Sustainability Threats,"This paper proposes a unified, condition-based framework for classifying both legacy and cloud-era denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The framework comprises three interrelated models: a formal conditional tree taxonomy, a hierarchical lattice structure based on order theory, and a conceptual Venn diagram. At its core, the taxonomy introduces six observable conditions (C0-C5) grounded in real-world attack behaviours, including source distribution, traffic volume, infrastructure targeting, and financial exploitation. These conditions enable consistent classification of known attacks-such as DoS, DDoS, LDoS, LDDoS, EDoS, DoW, and DDoW, while supporting identification of emerging or hybrid variants. The lattice structure captures the cumulative satisfaction of conditions, allowing hierarchical reasoning across denial attack classes. The Venn diagram highlights conceptual overlaps between availability- and sustainability-focused attacks, improving comparative insight. Together, these models provide a robust analytical lens for threat modeling, mitigation strategy design, and attacker intent classification. The framework is particularly relevant in cloud-native and serverless environments, where sustainability-based attacks are increasingly impactful yet under-recognised. Its extensibility also permits future integration of socio-technical or behavioural dimensions. By offering a structured taxonomy with theoretical grounding and real-world applicability, this work advances denial attack comprehension and equips defenders, researchers, and cloud architects with a shared vocabulary for interpreting and mitigating evolving threat vectors.",2025-08-24 13:23:09+00:00,2025-08-24 13:23:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19283v1
"MetaFed: Advancing Privacy, Performance, and Sustainability in Federated Metaverse Systems","The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.",2025-11-05 11:07:34+00:00,2025-08-24 12:53:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17341v3
Keystroke Detection by Exploiting Unintended RF Emission from Repaired USB Keyboards,"Electronic devices and cables inadvertently emit RF emissions as a byproduct of signal processing and/or transmission. Labeled as electromagnetic emanations, they form an EM side-channel for data leakage. Previously, it was believed that such leakage could be contained within a facility since they are weak signals with a short transmission range. However, in the preliminary version of this work [1], we found that the traditional cable repairing process forms a tiny monopole antenna that helps emanations transmit over a long range. Experimentation with three types of cables revealed that emanations from repaired cables remain detectable even at >4 m and can penetrate a 14 cm thick concrete wall. In this extended version, we show that such emanation can be exploited at a long distance for information extraction by detecting keystrokes typed on a repaired USB keyboard. By collecting data for 70 different keystrokes at different distances from the target in 3 diverse environments (open space, a corridor outside an office room, and outside a building) and developing an efficient detection algorithm, ~100% keystroke detection accuracy has been achieved up to 12 m distance, which is the highest reported accuracy at such a long range for USB keyboards in the literature. The effect of two experimental factors, interference and human-body coupling, has been investigated thoroughly. Along with exploring the vulnerability, multi-layer external metal shielding during the repairing process as a possible remedy has been explored. This work exposes a new attack surface caused by hardware modification, its exploitation, and potential countermeasures.",2025-08-24 07:43:30+00:00,2025-08-24 07:43:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00043v1
Exposing Privacy Risks in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date knowledge. Graph RAG has emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new, under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for building more secure systems.",2025-08-24 06:19:44+00:00,2025-08-24 06:19:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17222v1
Rao Differential Privacy,"Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.",2025-08-23 20:25:59+00:00,2025-08-23 20:25:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17135v1
Post-Quantum Blockchain: Challenges and Opportunities,"Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that offers numerous benefits including decentralization, transparency, efficiency, and reduced costs. Hence, blockchain has been included in many fields. Blockchain relies on cryptographic protocols (especially public-key cryptography and hash functions) to achieve many essential sub-routines. However, the increased progress of quantum computation and algorithms has threatened the security of many traditional cryptosystems. Therefore, this represents a serious risk for the existing blockchain technology. For example, SHA-256 and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptosystems can be compromised by Shor s and Grover s quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is a basic solution for resisting these quantum attacks. Applying PQC to blockchains results in creating Post-Quantum Blockchains (PQB). Thus, this paper aims to review the threats imposed by quantum computers on classical blockchain technology and provide useful guidelines on PQB security to blockchain researchers. The paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities of future work direction in this field.",2025-08-23 15:53:49+00:00,2025-08-23 15:53:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17071v1
GRAID: Synthetic Data Generation with Geometric Constraints and Multi-Agentic Reflection for Harmful Content Detection,"We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i) generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and (ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.",2025-08-23 15:09:58+00:00,2025-08-23 15:09:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17057v1
Investigating red packet fraud in Android applications: Insights from user reviews,"With the popularization of smartphones, red packets have been widely used in mobile apps. However, the issues of fraud associated with them have also become increasingly prominent. As reported in user reviews from mobile app markets, many users have complained about experiencing red packet fraud and being persistently troubled by fraudulent red packets. To uncover this phenomenon, we conduct the first investigation into an extensive collection of user reviews on apps with red packets. In this paper, we first propose a novel automated approach, ReckDetector, for effectively identifying apps with red packets from app markets. We then collect over 360,000 real user reviews from 334 apps with red packets available on Google Play and three popular alternative Android app markets. We preprocess the user reviews to extract those related to red packets and fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to identify negative reviews. Finally, based on semantic analysis, we have summarized six distinct categories of red packet fraud issues reported by users. Through our study, we found that red packet fraud is highly prevalent, significantly impacting user experience and damaging the reputation of apps. Moreover, red packets have been widely exploited by unscrupulous app developers as a deceptive incentive mechanism to entice users into completing their designated tasks, thereby maximizing their profits.",2025-08-23 08:19:26+00:00,2025-08-23 08:19:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16941v1
Targeted Wearout Attacks in Microprocessor Cores,"Negative-Bias Temperature Instability is a dominant aging mechanism in nanoscale CMOS circuits such as microprocessors. With this aging mechanism, the rate of device aging is dependent not only on overall operating conditions, such as heat, but also on user controllable inputs to the transistors. This dependence on input implies a possible timing fault-injection attack wherein a targeted path of logic is intentionally degraded through the purposeful, software-driven actions of an attacker, rendering a targeted bit effectively stuck.   In this work, we describe such an attack mechanism, which we dub a ""$\textbf{Targeted Wearout Attack}$"", wherein an attacker with sufficient knowledge of the processor core, executing a carefully crafted software program with only user privilege, is able to degrade a functional unit within the processor with the aim of eliciting a particular desired incorrect calculation in a victim application. Here we give a general methodology for the attack. We then demonstrate a case study where a targeted path within the fused multiply-add pipeline in a RISC-V CPU sees a $>7x$ increase in wear over time than would be experienced under typical workloads. We show that an attacker could leverage such an attack, leading to targeted and silent data corruption in a co-running victim application using the same unit.",2025-08-23 01:54:21+00:00,2025-08-23 01:54:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16868v1
"zkPHIRE: A Programmable Accelerator for ZKPs over HIgh-degRee, Expressive Gates","Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as powerful tools for secure and privacy-preserving computation. ZKPs enable one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing anything else. This capability has profound implications in many domains, including: machine learning, blockchain, image authentication, and electronic voting. Despite their potential, ZKPs have seen limited deployment because of their exceptionally high computational overhead, which manifests primarily during proof generation. To mitigate these overheads, a (growing) body of researchers has proposed hardware accelerators and GPU implementations for kernels and complete protocols. Prior art spans a wide variety of ZKP schemes that vary significantly in computational overhead, proof size, verifier cost, protocol setup, and trust. The latest, and widely used ZKP protocols are intentionally designed to balance these trade-offs. A particular challenge in modern ZKP systems is supporting complex, high-degree gates using the SumCheck protocol. We address this challenge with a novel programmable accelerator that efficiently handles arbitrary custom gates via SumCheck. Our accelerator achieves upwards of $1000\times$ geomean speedup over CPU-based SumChecks across a range of gate types. We integrate this unit into a full-system accelerator, zkPHIRE, which achieves $1486\times$ geomean speedup over CPU and $11.87\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art at iso-area. zkPHIRE is the first accelerator to scale to problem sizes of $2^{30}$ nominal constraints while maintaining small proof sizes and programmability.",2025-08-22 18:27:26+00:00,2025-08-22 18:27:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16738v1
Retrieval-Augmented Defense: Adaptive and Controllable Jailbreak Prevention for Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including (1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining, and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying, malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a controllable manner.",2025-11-03 15:40:21+00:00,2025-08-22 14:13:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16406v2
A Relay-Chain-Powered Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption in Intelligent Transportation Systems,"The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional domains.",2025-08-22 08:11:23+00:00,2025-08-22 08:11:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16189v1
The Aegis Protocol: A Foundational Security Framework for Autonomous AI Agents,"The proliferation of autonomous AI agents marks a paradigm shift toward complex, emergent multi-agent systems. This transition introduces systemic security risks, including control-flow hijacking and cascading failures, that traditional cybersecurity paradigms are ill-equipped to address. This paper introduces the Aegis Protocol, a layered security framework designed to provide strong security guarantees for open agentic ecosystems. The protocol integrates three technological pillars: (1) non-spoofable agent identity via W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs); (2) communication integrity via NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC); and (3) verifiable, privacy-preserving policy compliance using the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. We formalize an adversary model extending Dolev-Yao for agentic threats and validate the protocol against the STRIDE framework. Our quantitative evaluation used a discrete-event simulation, calibrated against cryptographic benchmarks, to model 1,000 agents. The simulation showed a 0 percent success rate across 20,000 attack trials. For policy verification, analysis of the simulation logs reported a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds, establishing a performance baseline for this class of security. While the evaluation is simulation-based and early-stage, it offers a reproducible baseline for future empirical studies and positions Aegis as a foundation for safe, scalable autonomous AI.",2025-08-22 06:18:57+00:00,2025-08-22 06:18:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19267v1
PickleBall: Secure Deserialization of Pickle-based Machine Learning Models (Extended Report),"Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading.   We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.",2025-09-19 03:02:49+00:00,2025-08-21 22:14:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15987v2
VideoEraser: Concept Erasure in Text-to-Video Diffusion Models,"The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on average across four tasks compared to baselines.",2025-08-27 08:48:35+00:00,2025-08-21 07:15:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15314v2
"Connected and Exposed: Cybersecurity Risks, Regulatory Gaps, and Public Perception in Internet-Connected Vehicles","The rapid advancement of Internet-connected vehicle technologies has introduced a new era of smart mobility, while simultaneously raising significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This paper explores the evolving threat landscape associated with connected vehicles, focusing on risks such as unauthorized remote access and the potential leakage of personal data. To assess the current state of protection, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 16 international standards and regulations, evaluating them from multiple perspectives including regulatory strength, technical specificity, treatment of supply chain risks, and approaches to personal data handling.   In parallel, we carried out a user-focused survey designed to map consumer attitudes toward smart cars. The survey investigated which types of vehicles users trust and prefer, the reasons behind rejecting certain car types, their awareness of data-related risks, and whether they feel adequately informed about how their vehicles handle data. By combining regulatory analysis with user perception insights, this study aims to contribute to a more holistic understanding of the challenges and expectations surrounding connected vehicle ecosystems.",2025-08-21 06:51:54+00:00,2025-08-21 06:51:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15306v1
Conditional Cube Attack on Round-Reduced ASCON,"This paper evaluates the secure level of authenticated encryption \textsc{Ascon} against cube-like method. \textsc{Ascon} submitted by Dobraunig \emph{et~al.} is one of 16 survivors of the 3rd round CAESAR competition. The cube-like method is first used by Dinur \emph{et~al.} to analyze Keccak keyed modes. At CT-RSA 2015, Dobraunig \emph{et~al.} applied this method to 5/6-round reduced \textsc{Ascon}, whose structure is similar to Keccak keyed modes. However, for \textsc{Ascon} the non-linear layer is more complex and state is much smaller, which make it hard for the attackers to select enough cube variables that do not multiply with each other after the first round. This seems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round \textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the attacked round is no less than 7-round.   In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang \emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for 5/6-round reduced \textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round attack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time complexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on \textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we divide the full key space into many subsets according to different key conditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the key falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the key subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a weak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and costs only $2^{77}$ time complexity. Those attacks do not threaten the full round (12 rounds) \textsc{Ascon}.",2025-08-21 02:17:50+00:00,2025-08-21 02:17:50+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15172v1
When Machine Learning Meets Vulnerability Discovery: Challenges and Lessons Learned,"In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive results in various fields, including software vulnerability detection. Nonetheless, using machine learning to identify software vulnerabilities presents new challenges, especially regarding the scale of data involved, which was not a factor in traditional methods. Consequently, in spite of the rise of new machine-learning-based approaches in that space, important shortcomings persist regarding their evaluation. First, researchers often fail to provide concrete statistics about their training datasets, such as the number of samples for each type of vulnerability. Moreover, many methods rely on training with semantically similar functions rather than directly on vulnerable programs. This leads to uncertainty about the suitability of the datasets currently used for training. Secondly, the choice of a model and the level of granularity at which models are trained also affect the effectiveness of such vulnerability discovery approaches.   In this paper, we explore the challenges of applying machine learning to vulnerability discovery. We also share insights from our two previous research papers, Bin2vec and BinHunter, which could enhance future research in this field.",2025-08-20 20:09:49+00:00,2025-08-20 20:09:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15042v1
A Systematic Survey of Model Extraction Attacks and Defenses: State-of-the-Art and Perspectives,"Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.",2025-08-27 05:10:26+00:00,2025-08-20 19:49:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15031v2
Foe for Fraud: Transferable Adversarial Attacks in Credit Card Fraud Detection,"Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.",2025-08-20 13:23:28+00:00,2025-08-20 13:23:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14699v1
Leuvenshtein: Efficient FHE-based Edit Distance Computation with Single Bootstrap per Cell,"This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94 operations -- required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm -- to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to $278\times$ faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to $39\times$ faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional $3\times$ speedup can be achieved.",2025-08-20 09:40:06+00:00,2025-08-20 09:40:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14568v1
Boosting Payment Channel Network Liquidity with Topology Optimization and Transaction Selection,"Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected (entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$ cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning Network.",2025-08-20 08:34:20+00:00,2025-08-20 08:34:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14524v1
Markov Chain-based Model of Blockchain Radio Access Networks,"Security has always been a priority, for researchers, service providers and network operators when it comes to radio access networks (RAN). One wireless access approach that has captured attention is blockchain enabled RAN (B-RAN) due to its secure nature. This research introduces a framework that integrates blockchain technology into RAN while also addressing the limitations of state-of-the-art models. The proposed framework utilizes queuing and Markov chain theory to model the aspects of B-RAN. An extensive evaluation of the models performance is provided, including an analysis of timing factors and a focused assessment of its security aspects. The results demonstrate reduced latency and comparable security making the presented framework suitable for diverse application scenarios.",2025-08-20 08:28:30+00:00,2025-08-20 08:28:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14519v1
Linkage Attacks Expose Identity Risks in Public ECG Data Sharing,"The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109 participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85% accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a 14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with 15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in healthcare applications.",2025-08-20 05:52:10+00:00,2025-08-20 05:52:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15850v1
Self-Disguise Attack: Induce the LLM to disguise itself for AIGT detection evasion,"AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models (LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.",2025-08-20 04:17:03+00:00,2025-08-20 04:17:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15848v1
Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization,"Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.",2025-08-20 03:25:59+00:00,2025-08-20 03:25:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385v1
MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing,"Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.",2025-08-19 22:42:04+00:00,2025-08-19 22:42:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300v1
SaMOSA: Sandbox for Malware Orchestration and Side-Channel Analysis,"Cyber-attacks on operational technology (OT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have increased tremendously in recent years with the proliferation of malware targeting Linux-based embedded devices of OT and CPS systems. Comprehensive malware detection requires dynamic analysis of execution behavior in addition to static analysis of binaries. Safe execution of malware in a manner that captures relevant behaviors via side-channels requires a sandbox environment. Existing Linux sandboxes are built for specific tasks, only capture one or two side-channels, and do not offer customization for different analysis tasks. We present the SaMOSA Linux sandbox that allows emulation of Linux malwares while capturing time-synchronized side-channels from four sources. SaMOSA additionally provides emulation of network services via FakeNet, and allows orchestration and customization of the sandbox environment via pipeline hooks. In comparison to existing Linux sandboxes, SaMOSA captures more side-channels namely system calls, network activity, disk activity, and hardware performance counters. It supports three architectures predominantly used in OT and CPS namely x86-64, ARM64, and PowerPC 64. SaMOSA fills a gap in Linux malware analysis by providing a modular and customizable sandbox framework that can be adapted for many malware analysis tasks. We present three case studies of three different malware families to demonstrate the advantages of SaMOSA.",2025-08-19 20:41:24+00:00,2025-08-19 20:41:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14261v1
Unveiling Unicode's Unseen Underpinnings in Undermining Authorship Attribution,"When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.",2025-10-30 16:25:05+00:00,2025-08-19 17:34:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15840v3
CIA+TA Risk Assessment for AI Reasoning Vulnerabilities,"As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence: identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135% amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.",2025-08-19 13:56:09+00:00,2025-08-19 13:56:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15839v1
"On the Security and Privacy of Federated Learning: A Survey with Attacks, Defenses, Frameworks, Applications, and Future Directions","Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm enabling multiple clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing their raw data. While FL enhances data privacy by design, it remains vulnerable to various security and privacy threats. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of more than 200 papers regarding the state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms developed to address these challenges, categorizing them into security-enhancing and privacy-preserving techniques. Security-enhancing methods aim to improve FL robustness against malicious behaviors such as byzantine attacks, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. At the same time, privacy-preserving techniques focus on protecting sensitive data through cryptographic approaches, differential privacy, and secure aggregation. We critically analyze the strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlight the trade-offs between privacy, security, and model performance, and discuss the implications of non-IID data distributions on the effectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, we identify open research challenges and future directions, including the need for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient solutions operating in dynamic and heterogeneous FL environments. Our survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing robust and privacy-preserving FL systems, fostering advancements safeguarding collaborative learning frameworks' integrity and confidentiality.",2025-08-19 11:06:20+00:00,2025-08-19 11:06:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13730v1
Know Me by My Pulse: Toward Practical Continuous Authentication on Wearable Devices via Wrist-Worn PPG,"Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band, using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%, macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to 128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves robustness across physiological states.",2025-08-19 09:46:01+00:00,2025-08-19 09:46:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13690v1
"Conflicting Scores, Confusing Signals: An Empirical Study of Vulnerability Scoring Systems","Accurately assessing software vulnerabilities is essential for effective prioritization and remediation. While various scoring systems exist to support this task, their differing goals, methodologies and outputs often lead to inconsistent prioritization decisions. This work provides the first large-scale, outcome-linked empirical comparison of four publicly available vulnerability scoring systems: the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and the Exploitability Index. We use a dataset of 600 real-world vulnerabilities derived from four months of Microsoft's Patch Tuesday disclosures to investigate the relationships between these scores, evaluate how they support vulnerability management task, how these scores categorize vulnerabilities across triage tiers, and assess their ability to capture the real-world exploitation risk. Our findings reveal significant disparities in how scoring systems rank the same vulnerabilities, with implications for organizations relying on these metrics to make data-driven, risk-based decisions. We provide insights into the alignment and divergence of these systems, highlighting the need for more transparent and consistent exploitability, risk, and severity assessments.",2025-08-19 08:54:58+00:00,2025-08-19 08:54:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13644v1

The main objective of the CAI framework is to accelerate the widespread adoption and effective use of artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity solutions, pathing the way to vibe-hacking, the cybersecurity analogon to vibe-coding.   CAI Fluency builds upon the Framework for AI Fluency, adapting its three modalities of human-AI interaction and four core competencies specifically for cybersecurity applications. This theoretical foundation ensures that practitioners develop not just technical skills, but also the critical thinking and ethical awareness necessary for responsible AI use in security contexts.

DDoS Attacks in Cloud Computing: Detection and Prevention,"DDoS attacks are one of the most prevalent and harmful cybersecurity threats faced by organizations and individuals today. In recent years, the complexity and frequency of DDoS attacks have increased significantly, making it challenging to detect and mitigate them effectively. The study analyzes various types of DDoS attacks, including volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks, and discusses the characteristics, impact, and potential targets of each type. It also examines the existing techniques used for DDoS attack detection, such as packet filtering, intrusion detection systems, and machine learning-based approaches, and their strengths and limitations. Moreover, the study explores the prevention techniques employed to mitigate DDoS attacks, such as firewalls, rate limiting , CPP and ELD mechanism. It evaluates the effectiveness of each approach and its suitability for different types of attacks and environments. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of DDoS attacks, their detection, and prevention techniques. It aims to provide insights and guidelines for organizations and individuals to enhance their cybersecurity posture and protect against DDoS attacks.",2025-08-19 05:27:37+00:00,2025-08-19 05:27:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13522v1
Optimizing Scalar Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Differential Evolution for Enhanced Security,"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern public-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures, key exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication, denoted as $k \cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar, relies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$ is selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in resource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches may yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to side-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly maximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary representations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically uniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection as an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based cryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly higher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be integrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable alternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain, secure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.",2025-08-19 05:26:07+00:00,2025-08-19 05:26:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13520v1
CCFC: Core & Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection,"Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.",2025-08-19 04:17:21+00:00,2025-08-19 04:17:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128v1
When Secure Aggregation Falls Short: Achieving Long-Term Privacy in Asynchronous Federated Learning for LEO Satellite Networks,"Secure aggregation is a common technique in federated learning (FL) for protecting data privacy from both curious internal entities (clients or server) and external adversaries (eavesdroppers). However, in dynamic and resource-constrained environments such as low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, traditional secure aggregation methods fall short in two aspects: (1) they assume continuous client availability while LEO satellite visibility is intermittent and irregular; (2) they consider privacy in each communication round but have overlooked the possible privacy leakage through multiple rounds. To address these limitations, we propose LTP-FLEO, an asynchronous FL framework that preserves long-term privacy (LTP) for LEO satellite networks. LTP-FLEO introduces (i) privacy-aware satellite partitioning, which groups satellites based on their predictable visibility to the server and enforces joint participation; (ii) model age balancing, which mitigates the adverse impact of stale model updates; and (iii) fair global aggregation, which treats satellites of different visibility durations in an equitable manner. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that LTP-FLEO effectively safeguards both model and data privacy across multi-round training, promotes fairness in line with satellite contributions, accelerates global convergence, and achieves competitive model accuracy.",2025-08-19 00:55:04+00:00,2025-08-19 00:55:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13425v1
AuthenTree: A Scalable MPC-Based Distributed Trust Architecture for Chiplet-based Heterogeneous Systems,"The rapid adoption of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is reshaping semiconductor design by enabling modular, scalable, and faster time-to-market solutions for AI and high-performance computing. However, multi-vendor assembly in post-fabrication environments fragments the supply chain and exposes SiP systems to serious security threats, including cloning, overproduction, and chiplet substitution. Existing authentication solutions depend on trusted integrators or centralized security anchors, which can expose sensitive data or create single points of failure. We introduce AuthenTree, a distributed authentication framework that leverages multi-party computation (MPC) in a scalable tree-based architecture, removing the need for dedicated security hardware or centralized trust. AuthenTree enables secure chiplet validation without revealing raw signatures, distributing trust across multiple integrator chiplets. Our evaluation in five SiP benchmarks demonstrates that AuthenTree imposes minimal overhead, with an area as low as 0.48% (7,000 sq-micrometers), an overhead power under 0.5%, and an authentication latency below 1 microsecond, surpassing previous work in some cases by 700 times. These results establish AuthenTree as an efficient, robust, and scalable solution for next-generation chiplet-based security in zero-trust SiP environments.",2025-08-18 15:51:48+00:00,2025-08-18 15:51:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13033v1
The Application of Transformer-Based Models for Predicting Consequences of Cyber Attacks,"Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is, comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently, there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models. Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$, far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences of a cyberattack.",2025-08-18 15:46:36+00:00,2025-08-18 15:46:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13030v1
Prescriptive Zero Trust- Assessing the impact of zero trust on cyber attack prevention,"Increasingly sophisticated and varied cyber threats necessitate ever improving enterprise security postures. For many organizations today, those postures have a foundation in the Zero Trust Architecture. This strategy sees trust as something an enterprise must not give lightly or assume too broadly. Understanding the ZTA and its numerous controls centered around the idea of not trusting anything inside or outside the network without verification, will allow organizations to comprehend and leverage this increasingly common paradigm. The ZTA, unlike many other regulatory frameworks, is not tightly defined. The research assesses the likelihood of quantifiable guidelines that measure cybersecurity maturity for an enterprise organization in relation to ZTA implementation. This is a new, data driven methodology for quantifying cyber resilience enabled by the adoption of Zero Trust principles to pragmatically address the critical need of organizations. It also looks at the practical aspects ZTA has on capabilities in deterring cyberattacks on a network. The outcomes of this research define a prescriptive set of key technical controls across identity verification, microsegmentation, data encryption, analytics, and orchestration that characterize the comprehensive ZTA deployment. By evaluating the depth of integration for each control component and aligning to industry best practices, the study's results help assess an organization's ZTA maturity level on a scale from Initial to Optimized adoption. The research's resultant four tier model demarcates phases for an organization on its security transformation journey, with each tier adding to the capability of the last.",2025-08-18 14:30:00+00:00,2025-08-18 14:30:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12953v1
FuSaR: A Fuzzification-Based Method for LRM Safety-Reasoning Balance,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of LRMs.",2025-08-18 12:54:16+00:00,2025-08-18 12:54:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12897v1
The covering radius of Butson Hadamard codes for the homogeneous metric,"Butson matrices are complex Hadamard matrices with entries in the complex roots of unity of given order. There is an interesting code in phase space related to this matrix (Armario et al. 2023). We study the covering radius of Butson Hadamard codes for the homogeneous metric, a metric defined uniquely, up to scaling, for a commutative ring alphabet that is Quasi Frobenius. An upper bound is derived by an orthogonal array argument. A lower bound relies on the existence of bent sequences in the sense of (Shi et al. 2022). This latter bound generalizes a bound of (Armario et al. 2025) for the Hamming metric.",2025-08-18 11:57:15+00:00,2025-08-18 11:57:15+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12859v1
Involuntary Jailbreak,"In this study, we disclose a worrying new vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs), which we term \textbf{involuntary jailbreak}. Unlike existing jailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a specific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \textit{building a bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the LLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise the entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly fragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal. In particular, we instruct LLMs to generate several questions that would typically be rejected, along with their corresponding in-depth responses (rather than a refusal). Remarkably, this simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the majority of leading LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT 4.1. We hope this problem can motivate researchers and practitioners to re-evaluate the robustness of LLM guardrails and contribute to stronger safety alignment in future.",2025-08-18 10:38:30+00:00,2025-08-18 10:38:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13246v1
UAV Individual Identification via Distilled RF Fingerprints-Based LLM in ISAC Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) individual (ID) identification is a critical security surveillance strategy in low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled wireless radio frequency fingerprint large language model (RFF-LLM) framework for UAV ID identification. First, we propose an RFF-LLM framework based on the modified GPT-2 model to improve the identification accuracy in complex outdoor environments. Then, considering the parameter overhead of the RFF-LLM, we design a dynamic KD strategy to compress the model. Specifically, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to dynamically adjust the distillation temperature, overcoming the local optimum dilemma inherent in static KD. As a next step, the knowledge of the RFF-LLM is adequately transferred to the lightweight Lite-HRNet model. Finally, our experiments are conducted based on the self-built drone RFF dataset of Release one, namely DRFF-R1, by collecting the I/Q signals of 20 commercial UAVs in channel 149. The experiment results show that the proposed framework achieves 98.38% ID identification accuracy with merely 0.15 million parameters and 2.74 ms response time, which outperforms the benchmarks.",2025-08-31 08:15:18+00:00,2025-08-18 03:14:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12597v2
Data-driven Trust Bootstrapping for Mobile Edge Computing-based Industrial IoT Services,"We propose a data-driven and context-aware approach to bootstrap trustworthiness of homogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) services in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The proposed approach addresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches into MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of opportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over a prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness, inability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to receive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known service as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC environments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation. In addition, the proposed approach also tackles the problem of data sparsity via enabling knowledge sharing among different MEC environments within a given MEC topology. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets suitably adjusted to exhibit the context-dependent trust information accumulated in MEC environments within a given MEC topology. The experimental results affirmed the effectiveness of our approach and its suitability to bootstrap trustworthiness of services in MEC-based IIoT systems.",2025-08-18 01:37:34+00:00,2025-08-18 01:37:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12560v1
The Hidden Cost of Correlation: Rethinking Privacy Leakage in Local Differential Privacy,"Local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving data collection in distributed systems, where users contribute multi-dimensional records with potentially correlated attributes. Recent work has highlighted that correlation-induced privacy leakage (CPL) plays a critical role in shaping the privacy-utility trade-off under LDP, especially when correlations exist among attributes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear to what extent the prevailing assumptions and proposed solutions are valid and how significant CPL is in real-world data. To address this gap, we first perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of five widely used LDP mechanisms -- GRR, RAPPOR, OUE, OLH and Exponential mechanism -- to assess CPL across four real-world datasets. We identify that many primary assumptions and metrics in current approaches fall short of accurately characterising these leakages. Moreover, current studies have been limited to a set of pure LDP (i.e., {δ= 0}) mechanisms. In response, we develop the first algorithmic framework to theoretically quantify CPL for any general approximated LDP (({\varepsilon},δ)-LDP) mechanism. We validate our theoretical results against empirical statistical results and provide a theoretical explanation for the observed statistical patterns. Finally, we propose two novel benchmarks to validate correlation analysis algorithms and evaluate the utility vs CPL of LDP mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate how these findings can be applied to achieve an efficient privacy-utility trade-off in real-world data governance.",2025-08-18 00:34:04+00:00,2025-08-18 00:34:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12539v1
ChamaleoNet: Programmable Passive Probe for Enhanced Visibility on Erroneous Traffic,"Traffic visibility remains a key component for management and security operations. Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered traffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary failures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a transparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous traffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a client, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed to ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including those generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by external actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses several challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm, ChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network and focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection system while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the seamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can impersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN in-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting in a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil internal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and enhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for vulnerable services.",2025-08-17 20:54:41+00:00,2025-08-17 20:54:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12496v1
A Robust Cross-Domain IDS using BiGRU-LSTM-Attention for Medical and Industrial IoT Security,"The increased Internet of Medical Things IoMT and the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT interconnectivity has introduced complex cybersecurity challenges, exposing sensitive data, patient safety, and industrial operations to advanced cyber threats. To mitigate these risks, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based intrusion detection system IDS, termed BiGAT-ID a hybrid model that combines bidirectional gated recurrent units BiGRU, long short-term memory LSTM networks, and multi-head attention MHA. The proposed architecture is designed to effectively capture bidirectional temporal dependencies, model sequential patterns, and enhance contextual feature representation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, CICIoMT2024 medical IoT and EdgeIIoTset industrial IoT demonstrate the model's cross-domain robustness, achieving detection accuracies of 99.13 percent and 99.34 percent, respectively. Additionally, the model exhibits exceptional runtime efficiency, with inference times as low as 0.0002 seconds per instance in IoMT and 0.0001 seconds in IIoT scenarios. Coupled with a low false positive rate, BiGAT-ID proves to be a reliable and efficient IDS for deployment in real-world heterogeneous IoT environments",2025-08-17 18:50:23+00:00,2025-08-17 18:50:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12470v1
Passive Hack-Back Strategies for Cyber Attribution: Covert Vectors in Denied Environment,"Attributing cyberattacks remains a central challenge in modern cybersecurity, particularly within denied environments where defenders have limited visibility into attacker infrastructure and are restricted by legal or operational rules of engagement. This perspective examines the strategic value of passive hack-back techniques that enable covert attribution and intelligence collection without initiating direct offensive actions. Key vectors include tracking beacons, honeytokens, environment-specific payloads, and supply-chain-based traps embedded within exfiltrated or leaked assets. These approaches rely on the assumption that attackers will interact with compromised data in traceable ways, allowing defenders to gather signals without violating engagement policies. The paper also explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing passive hack-back operations. Topics include the deployment of autonomous agents for forensic reconnaissance, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dynamic payloads, and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) techniques for evasion and counter-deception. A dedicated section discusses the implications of quantum technologies in this context, both as future threats to cryptographic telemetry and as potential tools for stealthy communication and post-quantum resilience. Finally, the paper advocates for hybrid defensive frameworks that combine passive attribution with delayed or conditional active responses, while maintaining compliance with legal, ethical, and operational constraints.",2025-08-17 16:43:23+00:00,2025-08-17 16:43:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16637v1
Adjustable AprilTags For Identity Secured Tasks,"Special tags such as AprilTags that facilitate image processing and pattern recognition are useful in practical applications. In close and private environments, identity security is unlikely to be an issue because all involved AprilTags can be completely regulated. However, in open and public environments, identity security is no longer an issue that can be neglected. To handle potential harm caused by adversarial attacks, this note advocates utilization of adjustable AprilTags instead of fixed ones.",2025-08-17 09:43:52+00:00,2025-08-17 09:43:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12304v1
Unlearning at Scale: Implementing the Right to be Forgotten in Large Language Models,"We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record (ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels, replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints, we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical equality of model and optimizer states.",2025-08-17 03:29:22+00:00,2025-08-17 03:29:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12220v1
AUTOVR: Automated UI Exploration for Detecting Sensitive Data Flow Exposures in Virtual Reality Apps,"The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) has provided developers with an unprecedented platform for creating games and applications (apps) that require distinct inputs, different from those of conventional devices like smartphones. The Meta Quest VR platform, driven by Meta, has democratized VR app publishing and attracted millions of users worldwide. However, as the number of published apps grows, there is a notable lack of robust headless tools for user interface (UI) exploration and user event testing. To address this need, we present AUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR apps built on the Unity Engine. Unlike conventional Android and GUI testers, AUTOVR analyzes the app's internal binary to reveal hidden events, resolves generative event dependencies, and utilizes them for comprehensive exploration of VR apps. Using sensitive data exposure as a performance metric, we compare AUTOVR with Android Monkey, a widely used headless Android GUI stress testing tool. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates AUTOVR's superior performance, triggering an order of magnitude of more sensitive data exposures and significantly enhancing the privacy of VR apps.",2025-08-17 00:22:58+00:00,2025-08-17 00:22:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12187v1
CAN Networks Security in Smart Grids Communication Technologies,"The rapid evolution of smart grids requires effective communication protocols to transfer data reliably and securely. Controller Area Network (CAN) is one of the most recognized protocols that offer reliable data transmission in smart grids due to its robustness, real-time capabilities, and relatively low initial cost of its required hardware. However, as a smart city becomes more interconnected, it also becomes more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As there are many mechanisms to secure the CAN nodes from attacks, most of those mechanisms have computational overhead, resulting in more delay in the network. We implemented a solution that requires almost no overhead to any CAN node connected to the network. It depends on a single node responsible for securing the CAN network. This approach seeks to augment network security while reducing security mechanisms overhead to all CAN network nodes. The methodology and comprehensive test results will be presented in detail during a subsequent discussion. The used software for development is Code Composer Studio, and the used microcontroller evaluation boards (EVB) are TM4C 1294.",2025-08-16 23:36:24+00:00,2025-08-16 23:36:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12181v1
Too Easily Fooled? Prompt Injection Breaks LLMs on Frustratingly Simple Multiple-Choice Questions,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions (e.g., ""What is 3 + 2?"") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.",2025-08-16 23:30:08+00:00,2025-08-16 23:30:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13214v1
Invitation Is All You Need! Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous,"The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.",2025-08-16 22:56:51+00:00,2025-08-16 22:56:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175v1
Attack Graph Generation on HPC Clusters,"Attack graphs (AGs) are graphical tools to analyze the security of computer networks. By connecting the exploitation of individual vulnerabilities, AGs expose possible multi-step attacks against target networks, allowing system administrators to take preventive measures to enhance their network's security. As powerful analytical tools, however, AGs are both time- and memory-consuming to be generated. As the numbers of network assets, interconnections between devices, as well as vulnerabilities increase, the size and volume of the resulting AGs grow at a much higher rate, leading to the well-known state-space explosion. In this paper, we propose the use of high performance computing (HPC) clusters to implement AG generators. We evaluate the performance through experiments and provide insights into how cluster environments can help resolve the issues of slow speed and high memory demands in AG generation in a balanced way.",2025-08-16 20:57:36+00:00,2025-08-16 20:57:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12161v1
Substituting Proof of Work in Blockchain with Training-Verified Collaborative Model Computation,"Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, while central to achieving decentralized consensus, has long been criticized for excessive energy use and hardware inefficiencies \cite{devries2018bitcoin, truby2018decarbonizing}. This paper introduces a hybrid architecture that replaces Bitcoin's traditional PoW with a centralized, cloud-based collaborative training framework. In this model, miners contribute computing resources to train segments of horizontally scaled machine learning models on preprocessed datasets, ensuring privacy and generating meaningful outputs \cite{li2017securing}. A central server evaluates contributions using two metrics: number of parameters trained and reduction in model loss during each cycle. At the end of every cycle, a weighted lottery selects the winning miner, who receives a digitally signed certificate. This certificate serves as a verifiable substitute for PoW and grants the right to append a block to the blockchain \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. By integrating digital signatures and SHA-256 hashing \cite{nist2015sha}, the system preserves blockchain integrity while redirecting energy toward productive computation. The proposed approach addresses the sustainability concerns of traditional mining by converting resource expenditure into socially valuable work, aligning security incentives with real-world computational progress.",2025-08-16 19:12:34+00:00,2025-08-16 19:12:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12138v1
Mitigating Jailbreaks with Intent-Aware LLMs,"Despite extensive safety-tuning, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks via adversarially crafted instructions, reflecting a persistent trade-off between safety and task performance. In this work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions, Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks, thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly, our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords. Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/wj210/Intent_Jailbreak.",2025-08-23 06:11:04+00:00,2025-08-16 15:03:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12072v2
Rethinking Autonomy: Preventing Failures in AI-Driven Software Engineering,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs, irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance, overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative, autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight. Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control, prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.",2025-08-15 22:13:54+00:00,2025-08-15 22:13:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11824v1
Machine Learning-Based AES Key Recovery via Side-Channel Analysis on the ASCAD Dataset,"Cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA are widely used and they are mathematically robust and almost unbreakable but its implementation on physical devices often leak information through side channels, such as electromagnetic (EM) emissions, potentially compromising said theoretically secure algorithms. This paper investigates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques and Deep Learning models to exploit such leakage for partial key recovery. We use the public ASCAD `fixed' and `variable' key dataset, containing 700 and 1400 EM traces respectively from an AES-128 implementation on an 8-bit microcontroller. The problem is framed as a 256-class classification task where we target the output of the first-round S-box operation, which is dependent on a single key byte. We evaluate standard classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)), a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Residual Neural Network(ResNet). We also explore the utility of RF-based feature importance for dimensionality reduction. Crucially, we employ this domain-specific Key Rank metric for evaluation, showing its necessity over standard classification accuracy. Our results show that SVM and RF on full features perform poorly in key ranking. However, RF trained on reduced (top 100) identified via importance analysis achieves Rank 0 (successful key byte recovery) using almost half the attack traces. The implemented CNN also achieves Rank 0 efficiently using approximately 65 attack traces for the fixed-key dataset. The ResNets perform best on large and complex datasets but may not always be the best choice for simple fixed key dataset in terms of efficiency. Thus we conclude that models, particularly CNNs, ResNets and feature-selected RF, coupled with the Key Rank metric, are an effective tool for side-channel key recovery, confirming the practical vulnerability of the cryptographic implementations.",2025-08-15 21:46:09+00:00,2025-08-15 21:46:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11817v1
AegisBlock: A Privacy-Preserving Medical Research Framework using Blockchain,"Due to HIPAA and other privacy regulations, it is imperative to maintain patient privacy while conducting research on patient health records. In this paper, we propose AegisBlock, a patient-centric access controlled framework to share medical records with researchers such that the anonymity of the patient is maintained while ensuring the trustworthiness of the data provided to researchers. AegisBlock allows for patients to provide access to their medical data, verified by miners. A researcher submits a time-based range query to request access to records from a certain patient, and upon patient approval, access will be granted. Our experimental evaluation results show that AegisBlock is scalable with respect to the number of patients and hospitals in the system, and efficient with up to 50% of malicious miners.",2025-08-15 20:43:36+00:00,2025-08-15 20:43:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11797v1
Activate Me!: Designing Efficient Activation Functions for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption,"The growing adoption of machine learning in sensitive areas such as healthcare and defense introduces significant privacy and security challenges. These domains demand robust data protection, as models depend on large volumes of sensitive information for both training and inference. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations directly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire machine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear operations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions, essential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based machine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square function and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20 architectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we assess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a novel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE constraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in shallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per image. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The polynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image, while our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a longer inference time of 1,697 seconds. These results underscore a critical trade-off in FHE-based ML: faster activation functions often reduce accuracy, whereas those preserving accuracy demand greater computational resources.",2025-08-15 16:31:12+00:00,2025-08-15 16:31:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11575v1
Pushing the Limits of Frequency Analysis in Leakage Abuse Attacks,"Searchable encryption (SE) is the most scalable cryptographic primitive for searching on encrypted data. Typical SE constructions often allow access-pattern leakage, revealing which encrypted records are retrieved in the server's responses. All the known generic cryptanalyses assume either that the queries are issued uniformly at random or that the attacker observes the search-pattern leakage. It remains unclear what can be reconstructed when using only the access-pattern leakage and knowledge of the query distribution. In this work, we focus on the cryptanalytic technique of frequency analysis in the context of leakage-abuse attacks on schemes that support encrypted range queries. Frequency analysis matches the frequency of retrieval of an encrypted record with a plaintext value based on its probability of retrieval that follows from the knowledge of the query distribution. We generalize this underexplored cryptanalytic technique and introduce a generic attack framework called Leakage-Abuse via Matching (LAMA) that works even on high-dimensional encrypted data. We identify a parameterization of LAMA that brings frequency analysis to its limit -- that is, we prove that there is no additional frequency matching that an attacker can perform to refine the result. Furthermore, we show that our results hold for any class of convex queries, and not just axis-aligned rectangles, which is the assumption in all other attacks on range schemes. Using these results, we identify query distributions that make frequency analysis challenging for the attacker and, thus, can act as a mitigation mechanism. Finally, we implement and benchmark LAMA and reconstruct, for the first time, plaintext data from encrypted range queries spanning up to four dimensions.",2025-08-15 16:16:13+00:00,2025-08-15 16:16:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11563v1

Stablecoins represent the most significant evolution in banking since the abandonment of the gold standard, positioned to enable ""Banking 2.0"" by seamlessly integrating cryptocurrency innovation with traditional finance infrastructure. This transformation rivals artificial intelligence as the next major disruptor in the financial sector. Modern fiat currencies derive value entirely from institutional trust rather than physical backing, creating vulnerabilities that stablecoins address through enhanced stability, reduced fraud risk, and unified global transactions that transcend national boundaries. Recent developments demonstrate accelerating institutional adoption: landmark U.S. legislation including the GENIUS Act of 2025, strategic industry pivots from major players like JPMorgan's crypto-backed loan initiatives, and PayPal's comprehensive ""Pay with Crypto"" service. Widespread stablecoin implementation addresses critical macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the inflation-productivity gap plaguing modern monetary systems, through more robust and diversified backing mechanisms. Furthermore, stablecoins facilitate deregulation and efficiency gains, paving the way for a more interconnected international financial system. This whitepaper comprehensively explores how stablecoins are poised to reshape banking, supported by real-world examples, current market data, and analysis of their transformative potential.",2025-08-15 11:05:16+00:00,2025-08-15 11:05:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11395v1
Salty Seagull: A VSAT Honeynet to Follow the Bread Crumb of Attacks in Ship Networks,"Cyber threats against the maritime industry have increased notably in recent years, highlighting the need for innovative cybersecurity approaches. Ships, as critical assets, possess highly specialized and interconnected network infrastructures, where their legacy systems and operational constraints further exacerbate their vulnerability to cyberattacks. To better understand this evolving threat landscape, we propose the use of cyber-deception techniques and in particular honeynets, as a means to gather valuable insights into ongoing attack campaigns targeting the maritime sector.   In this paper we present Salty Seagull, a honeynet conceived to simulate a VSAT system for ships. This environment mimics the operations of a functional VSAT system onboard and, at the same time, enables a user to interact with it through a Web dashboard and a CLI environment. Furthermore, based on existing vulnerabilities, we purposefully integrate them into our system to increase attacker engagement. We exposed our honeynet for 30 days to the Internet to assess its capability and measured the received interaction. Results show that while numerous generic attacks have been attempted, only one curious attacker with knowledge of the nature of the system and its vulnerabilities managed to access it, without however exploring its full potential.",2025-08-15 08:51:25+00:00,2025-08-15 08:51:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11325v1
An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise,"Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share a common expectation $Σ$, the objective of Differentially Private Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the largest variance directions of $Σ$, while preserving differential privacy (DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n = \tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.",2025-08-14 17:48:45+00:00,2025-08-14 17:48:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879v1
SoK: Data Minimization in Machine Learning,"Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.",2025-08-14 17:00:13+00:00,2025-08-14 17:00:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10836v1
Data and Context Matter: Towards Generalizing AI-based Software Vulnerability Detection,"AI-based solutions demonstrate remarkable results in identifying vulnerabilities in software, but research has consistently found that this performance does not generalize to unseen codebases. In this paper, we specifically investigate the impact of model architecture, parameter configuration, and quality of training data on the ability of these systems to generalize.   For this purpose, we introduce VulGate, a high quality state of the art dataset that mitigates the shortcomings of prior datasets, by removing mislabeled and duplicate samples, updating new vulnerabilities, incorporating additional metadata, integrating hard samples, and including dedicated test sets. We undertake a series of experiments to demonstrate that improved dataset diversity and quality substantially enhances vulnerability detection. We also introduce and benchmark multiple encoder-only and decoder-only models. We find that encoder-based models outperform other models in terms of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves \textbf{6.8\%} improvement in recall on the benchmark BigVul dataset and outperforms others on unseen projects, demonstrating enhanced generalizability. Our results highlight the role of data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems with high cross-project effectiveness.",2025-10-06 19:18:35+00:00,2025-08-14 15:30:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16625v2
Bistochastically private release of longitudinal data,"Although the bulk of the research in privacy and statistical disclosure control is designed for cross-sectional data, i.e. data where individuals are observed at one single point in time, longitudinal data, i.e. individuals observed over multiple periods, are increasingly collected. Such data enhance undoubtedly the possibility of statistical analysis compared to cross-sectional data, but also come with one additional layer of information, individual trajectories, that must remain practically useful in a privacy-preserving way. Few extensions, essentially k-anonymity based, of popular privacy tools have been proposed to deal with the challenges posed by longitudinal data, and these proposals are often complex. By considering randomized response, and specifically its recent bistochastic extension, in the context of longitudinal data, this paper proposes a simple approach for their anonymization. After having characterized new results on bistochastic matrices, we show that a simple relationship exists between the protection of each data set released at each period, and the protection of individuals trajectories over time. In turn, this relationship can be tuned according to desired protection and information requirements. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach by an empirical example.",2025-08-14 12:48:06+00:00,2025-08-14 12:48:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10606v1
AlDBaran: Towards Blazingly Fast State Commitments for Blockchains,"The fundamental basis for maintaining integrity within contemporary blockchain systems is provided by authenticated databases. Our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain fail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing transactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial advancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from the critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update mechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data structure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput of 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically documented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most high-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.   AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a wide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran could enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to offer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.   When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects, AlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran achieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an identical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an attractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data capabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further enhances performance. On consumer-level portable hardware, it achieves approximately 8 million updates/s in an in-memory setting and 5 million updates/s with snapshots at sub-second intervals, illustrating compelling and cost-effective scalability.",2025-08-14 09:52:15+00:00,2025-08-14 09:52:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10493v1
Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches,"Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.",2025-08-31 05:43:55+00:00,2025-08-14 08:04:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10431v3
"Enhancing GraphQL Security by Detecting Malicious Queries Using Large Language Models, Sentence Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks","GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.",2025-10-08 06:22:30+00:00,2025-08-14 07:35:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11711v2
Code Vulnerability Detection Across Different Programming Languages with AI Models,"Security vulnerabilities present in a code that has been written in diverse programming languages are among the most critical yet complicated aspects of source code to detect. Static analysis tools based on rule-based patterns usually do not work well at detecting the context-dependent bugs and lead to high false positive rates. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, specifically the use of transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeLlama, provide light to this problem, as they show potential in finding such flaws better. This paper presents the implementations of these models on various datasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can successfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning of the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises the gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the model, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI. Experiments show that a well-trained CodeBERT can be as good as or even better than some existing static analyzers in terms of accuracy greater than 97%. Further study has indicated that although language models can achieve close-to-perfect recall, the precision can decrease. A solution to this is given by hybrid models and validation procedures, which will reduce false positives. According to the results, the AI-based solutions generalize to different programming languages and classes of vulnerability. Nevertheless, robustness, interpretability, and deployment readiness are still being developed. The results illustrate the probabilities that AI will enhance the trustworthiness in the usability and scalability of machine-learning-based detectors of vulnerabilities.",2025-08-14 05:41:58+00:00,2025-08-14 05:41:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11710v1
nodeWSNsec: A hybrid metaheuristic approach for reliable security and node deployment in WSNs,"Efficient and reliable node deployment in Wireless Sensor Networks is crucial for optimizing coverage of the area, connectivity among nodes, and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid meta heuristic approach combining a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the challenges of energy efficient and reliable node deployment. The GA PSO hybrid leverages GAs strong exploration capabilities and PSOs rapid convergence, achieving an optimum stability between coverage and energy consumption. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against GA and PSO alone and the innovatory meta heuristic based Competitive Multi Objective Marine Predators Algorithm (CMOMPA) across varying sensing ranges. Simulation results demonstrate that GA PSO requires 15% to 25% fewer sensor nodes and maintains 95% or more area coverage while maintaining the connectivity in comparison to standalone GA or PSO algorithm. The proposed algorithm also dominates CMOMPA when compared for long sensing and communication range in terms of higher coverage, improved connectivity, and reduced deployment time while requiring fewer sensor nodes. This study also explores key trade offs in WSN deployment and highlights future research directions, including heterogeneous node deployment, mobile WSNs, and enhanced multi objective optimization techniques. The findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid meta heuristics in improving WSN performance, offering a promising approach for real world applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, smart agriculture, disaster response, and IIoT.",2025-08-14 00:06:04+00:00,2025-08-14 00:06:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16619v1
Explainable Attention-Guided Stacked Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection,"Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.",2025-08-14 20:12:03+00:00,2025-08-13 13:33:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09801v2
Perfect message authentication codes are robust to small deviations from uniform key distributions,"We investigate the impact of (possible) deviations of the probability distribution of key values from a uniform distribution for the information-theoretic strong, or perfect, message authentication code. We found a simple expression for the decrease in security as a function of the statistical distance between the real key probability distribution and the uniform one. In a sense, a perfect message authentication code is robust to small deviations from a uniform key distribution.",2025-08-13 13:06:42+00:00,2025-08-13 13:06:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09783v1
Succinct Oblivious Tensor Evaluation and Applications: Adaptively-Secure Laconic Function Evaluation and Trapdoor Hashing for All Circuits,"We propose the notion of succinct oblivious tensor evaluation (OTE), where two parties compute an additive secret sharing of a tensor product of two vectors $\mathbf{x} \otimes \mathbf{y}$, exchanging two simultaneous messages. Crucially, the size of both messages and of the CRS is independent of the dimension of $\mathbf{x}$.   We present a construction of OTE with optimal complexity from the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. Then we show how this new technical tool enables a host of cryptographic primitives, all with security reducible to LWE, such as:   * Adaptively secure laconic function evaluation for depth-$D$ functions $f:\{0, 1\}^m\rightarrow\{0, 1\}^\ell$ with communication $m+\ell+D\cdot \mathrm{poly}(λ)$.   * A trapdoor hash function for all functions.   * An (optimally) succinct homomorphic secret sharing for all functions.   * A rate-$1/2$ laconic oblivious transfer for batch messages, which is best possible.   In particular, we obtain the first laconic function evaluation scheme that is adaptively secure from the standard LWE assumption, improving upon Quach, Wee, and Wichs (FOCS 2018).   As a key technical ingredient, we introduce a new notion of \emph{adaptive lattice encodings}, which may be of independent interest.",2025-08-13 10:03:03+00:00,2025-08-13 10:03:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09673v1
Social-Sensor Identity Cloning Detection Using Weakly Supervised Deep Forest and Cryptographic Authentication,"Recent years have witnessed a rising trend in social-sensor cloud identity cloning incidents. However, existing approaches suffer from unsatisfactory performance, a lack of solutions for detecting duplicated accounts, and a lack of large-scale evaluations on real-world datasets. We introduce a novel method for detecting identity cloning in social-sensor cloud service providers. Our proposed technique consists of two primary components: 1) a similar identity detection method and 2) a cryptography-based authentication protocol. Initially, we developed a weakly supervised deep forest model to identify similar identities using non-privacy-sensitive user profile features provided by the service. Subsequently, we designed a cryptography-based authentication protocol to verify whether similar identities were generated by the same provider. Our extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of our technique compared to current state-of-the-art identity clone detection methods.",2025-08-13 09:53:23+00:00,2025-08-13 09:53:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09665v1
Demystifying the Role of Rule-based Detection in AI Systems for Windows Malware Detection,"Malware detection increasingly relies on AI systems that integrate signature-based detection with machine learning. However, these components are typically developed and combined in isolation, missing opportunities to reduce data complexity and strengthen defenses against adversarial EXEmples, carefully crafted programs designed to evade detection. Hence, in this work we investigate the influence that signature-based detection exerts on model training, when they are included inside the training pipeline. Specifically, we compare models trained on a comprehensive dataset with an AI system whose machine learning component is trained solely on samples not already flagged by signatures. Our results demonstrate improved robustness to both adversarial EXEmples and temporal data drift, although this comes at the cost of a fixed lower bound on false positives, driven by suboptimal rule selection. We conclude by discussing these limitations and outlining how future research could extend AI-based malware detection to include dynamic analysis, thereby further enhancing system resilience.",2025-08-13 09:35:51+00:00,2025-08-13 09:35:51+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09652v1
Causal Graph Profiling via Structural Divergence for Robust Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems,"With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under ""Normal"" and ""Attack"" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.",2025-08-13 05:26:43+00:00,2025-08-13 05:26:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09504v1
CLIP-Flow: A Universal Discriminator for AI-Generated Images Inspired by Anomaly Detection,"With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images, which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs (generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by various image generators.",2025-08-13 04:12:37+00:00,2025-08-13 04:12:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09477v1
Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.",2025-08-12 20:10:31+00:00,2025-08-12 20:10:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v1
Decentralized Weather Forecasting via Distributed Machine Learning and Blockchain-Based Model Validation,"Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture, and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.",2025-08-14 07:18:06+00:00,2025-08-12 19:25:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09299v2
Can AI Keep a Secret? Contextual Integrity Verification: A Provable Security Architecture for LLMs,"Large language models (LLMs) remain acutely vulnerable to prompt injection and related jailbreak attacks; heuristic guardrails (rules, filters, LLM judges) are routinely bypassed. We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.",2025-08-18 18:20:18+00:00,2025-08-12 18:47:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09288v2
NetMoniAI: An Agentic AI Framework for Network Security & Monitoring,"In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with lightweight centralized coordination.

A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations. Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without compromising accuracy.

Enhance the machine learning algorithm performance in phishing detection with keyword features,"Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.",2025-08-12 14:16:11+00:00,2025-08-12 14:16:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09765v1
Redactable Blockchains: An Overview,"Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance, Internet of drones, and federated learning.

Never Compromise to Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Survey on AI Governance,"The rapid advancement of AI has expanded its capabilities across domains, yet introduced critical technical vulnerabilities, such as algorithmic bias and adversarial sensitivity, that pose significant societal risks, including misinformation, inequity, security breaches, physical harm, and eroded public trust. These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We propose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal dimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security (system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and Social Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach unifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights to promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a systematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1) the generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2) inadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3) fragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings stem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational design principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address the interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome this, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor with social responsibility. Our framework offers actionable guidance for researchers, engineers, and policymakers to develop AI systems that are not only robust and secure but also ethically aligned and publicly trustworthy. The accompanying repository is available at https://github.com/ZTianle/Awesome-AI-SG.",2025-08-18 09:25:19+00:00,2025-08-12 09:42:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08789v4
Approximate DBSCAN under Differential Privacy,"This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP). Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.",2025-08-13 14:25:42+00:00,2025-08-12 08:55:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08749v2
Special-Character Adversarial Attacks on Open-Source Language Model,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their vulnerability to character-level adversarial manipulations presents significant security challenges for real-world deployments. This paper presents a study of different special character attacks including unicode, homoglyph, structural, and textual encoding attacks aimed at bypassing safety mechanisms. We evaluate seven prominent open-source models ranging from 3.8B to 32B parameters on 4,000+ attack attempts. These experiments reveal critical vulnerabilities across all model sizes, exposing failure modes that include successful jailbreaks, incoherent outputs, and unrelated hallucinations.",2025-11-25 23:27:47+00:00,2025-08-12 03:42:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14070v2
Case Studies: Effective Approaches for Navigating Cross-Border Cloud Data Transfers Amid U.S. Government Privacy and Safety Concerns,"This study attempts to explain the impact of information exchange from one country to another, as well as the legal and technological implications for these exchanges. Due to the emergence of cloud technology, possibilities for free exchange of information between countries have increased rapidly, as it has become possible to save information in a country and access it in almost any part of the world. Countries all around the world have been confronted with developing frameworks to facilitate this process, although there are significant challenges which must be confronted on legal and technological fronts, as loopholes in the framework adopted by countries may hinder free access to information stored on cloud, and also compromise data privacy. Cloud technology is impacting a lot of issues, including domestic and international businesses, hence the need for a study to propose measures for safe exchange of information using cloud technology.",2025-08-12 01:35:07+00:00,2025-08-12 01:35:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00006v1
Securing Agentic AI: Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis for Network Monitoring Agentic AI System,"When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose, evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service, and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.",2025-08-12 00:14:12+00:00,2025-08-12 00:14:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10043v1
FIDELIS: Blockchain-Enabled Protection Against Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning,"Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is scalable.",2025-08-11 22:12:27+00:00,2025-08-11 22:12:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10042v1
Designing with Deception: ML- and Covert Gate-Enhanced Camouflaging to Thwart IC Reverse Engineering,"Integrated circuits (ICs) are essential to modern electronic systems, yet they face significant risks from physical reverse engineering (RE) attacks that compromise intellectual property (IP) and overall system security. While IC camouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches largely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive deception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception principles to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel And-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit representations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional preservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert gates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our methodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while presenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while achieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural overhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its practical applicability in securing IC designs. By bridging the gap in mimetic deception for hardware security, our work sets a new standard for IC camouflage, advancing the application of cyber deception principles to protect critical systems from adversarial threats.",2025-08-11 20:40:42+00:00,2025-08-11 20:40:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08462v1
Robust Anomaly Detection in O-RAN: Leveraging LLMs against Data Manipulation Attacks,"The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.",2025-08-11 14:32:43+00:00,2025-08-11 14:32:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08029v1
Quantum Prime Factorization: A Novel Approach Based on Fermat Method,"In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum algorithm for the factorization of composite odd numbers. This work makes two significant contributions. First, we present a new improvement to the classical Fermat method, fourfold reducing the computational complexity of factoring. Second, we reformulate Fermat factorization method as an optimization problem suitable for Quantum Annealers which allowed us to factorize 8,689,739, the biggest number ever factorized using a quantum device to our knowledge.",2025-08-11 13:46:23+00:00,2025-08-11 13:46:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10041v1
SCDF: A Speaker Characteristics DeepFake Speech Dataset for Bias Analysis,"Despite growing attention to deepfake speech detection, the aspects of bias and fairness remain underexplored in the speech domain. To address this gap, we introduce the Speaker Characteristics Deepfake (SCDF) dataset: a novel, richly annotated resource enabling systematic evaluation of demographic biases in deepfake speech detection. SCDF contains over 237,000 utterances in a balanced representation of both male and female speakers spanning five languages and a wide age range. We evaluate several state-of-the-art detectors and show that speaker characteristics significantly influence detection performance, revealing disparities across sex, language, age, and synthesizer type. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware development and provide a foundation for building non-discriminatory deepfake detection systems aligned with ethical and regulatory standards.",2025-08-11 12:58:37+00:00,2025-08-11 12:58:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07944v1
Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation,"Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.",2025-08-12 07:58:02+00:00,2025-08-11 08:24:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745v2
SRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function using Lightweight Hamming-Code Fuzzy Extractor for Energy Harvesting Beat Sensors,"Batteryless energy harvesting IoT sensor nodes such as beat sensors can be deployed in millions without the need to replace batteries. They are ultra-low-power and cost-effective wireless sensor nodes without the maintenance cost and can work for 24 hours/365 days. However, they were not equipped with security mechanisms to protect user data. Data encryption and authentication can be used to secure beat sensor applications, but generating a secure cryptographic key is challenging. In this paper, we proposed an SRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) combining a high-reliability bit selection algorithm with a lightweight error-correcting code to generate reliable secure keys for data encryption. The system employs a feature of beat sensors, in which the microcontroller is powered on to transmit the ID signals and then powered off. This fits the SRAM-based PUF requirement, which needs the SRAM to be powered off to read out its random values. The proposed system has been evaluated on STM32 Cortex M0+ microcontrollers and has been implemented to protect important data on beat sensors.",2025-08-10 23:41:06+00:00,2025-08-10 23:41:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07510v1
Certifiably robust malware detectors by design,"Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution, relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability. Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations. We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction of detection performance.",2025-08-10 09:19:29+00:00,2025-08-10 09:19:29+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10038v1
Civil Servants as Builders: Enabling Non-IT Staff to Develop Secure Python and R Tools,"Current digital government literature focuses on professional in-house IT teams, specialized digital service teams, vendor-developed systems, or proprietary low-code/no-code tools. Almost no scholarship addresses a growing middle ground: technically skilled civil servants outside formal IT roles who can write real code but lack a sanctioned, secure path to deploy their work. This paper introduces a limits-aware, open-source and replicable platform that enables such public servants to develop, peer review, and deploy small-scale, domain-specific applications within government networks via a sandboxed, auditable workflow. By combining Jupyter Notebooks, preapproved open-source libraries, and lightweight governance, the platform works within institutional constraints such as procurement rules and IT security policies while avoiding vendor lock-in. Unlike low/no-code approaches, it preserves and enhances civil servants' programming skills, keeping them technically competitive with their private-sector peers. This contribution fills a critical gap, offering a replicable model for public-sector skill retention, resilience, and bottom-up digital transformation.",2025-08-10 06:56:22+00:00,2025-08-10 06:56:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07203v1
Understanding NFTs from EIP Standards,"We argue that the technical foundations of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) remain inadequately understood. Prior research has focused on market dynamics, user behavior, and isolated security incidents, yet systematic analysis of the standards underpinning NFT functionality is largely absent.   We present the first study of NFTs through the lens of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 191 NFT-related EIPs and 10K+ Ethereum Magicians discussions (as of July, 2025). We integrate multi-dimensional analyses including the automated parsing of Solidity interfaces, graph-based modeling of inheritance structures, contributor profiling, and mining of community discussion data. We distinguish foundational from emerging standards, expose poor cross-version interoperability, and show that growing functional complexity heightens security risks.",2025-08-10 05:46:11+00:00,2025-08-10 05:46:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07190v1
"A Real-Time, Self-Tuning Moderator Framework for Adversarial Prompt Detection","Ensuring LLM alignment is critical to information security as AI models become increasingly widespread and integrated in society. Unfortunately, many defenses against adversarial attacks and jailbreaking on LLMs cannot adapt quickly to new attacks, degrade model responses to benign prompts, or introduce significant barriers to scalable implementation. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a real-time, self-tuning (RTST) moderator framework to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining a lightweight training footprint. We empirically evaluate its effectiveness using Google's Gemini models against modern, effective jailbreaks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of an adaptive, minimally intrusive framework for jailbreak defense over traditional fine-tuning or classifier models.",2025-08-10 01:59:07+00:00,2025-08-10 01:59:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07139v1
"ScamDetect: Towards a Robust, Agnostic Framework to Uncover Threats in Smart Contracts","Smart contracts have transformed decentralized finance by enabling programmable, trustless transactions. However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.",2025-08-12 11:39:01+00:00,2025-08-09 20:38:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07094v2
Neural Network-Based Detection and Multi-Class Classification of FDI Attacks in Smart Grid Home Energy Systems,"False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns, which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms, thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid cybersecurity from residential endpoints.",2025-08-09 18:27:31+00:00,2025-08-09 18:27:31+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10035v1
SPARE: Securing Progressive Web Applications Against Unauthorized Replications,"WebView applications are widely used in mobile applications to display web content directly within the app, enhancing user engagement by eliminating the need to open an external browser and providing a seamless experience. Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) further improve usability by combining the accessibility of web apps with the speed, offline capabilities, and responsiveness of native applications. However, malicious developers can exploit this technology by duplicating PWA web links to create counterfeit native apps, monetizing through user diversion. This unethical practice poses significant risks to users and the original application developers, underscoring the need for robust security measures to prevent unauthorized replication. Considering the one-way communication of Trusted Web Activity (a method for integrating web content into Android applications) and PWAs, we propose a query parameter-based practical security solution to defend against or mitigate such attacks. We analyze the vulnerabilities of our proposed security solution to assess its effectiveness and introduce advanced measures to address any identified weaknesses, presenting a comprehensive defense framework. As part of our work, we developed a prototype web application that secures PWAs from replication by embedding a combination of Unix timestamps and device identifiers into the query parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of this defense strategy by simulating an advanced attack scenario. Additionally, we created a realistic dataset reflecting mobile app user behavior, modeled using a Zipfian distribution, to validate our framework.",2025-08-09 17:40:13+00:00,2025-08-09 17:40:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07053v1
Cognitive Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence: Guardrail Engineering with CCS-7,"Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark, we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a ""Think First, Verify Always"" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans, in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.",2025-08-09 15:46:30+00:00,2025-08-09 15:46:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10033v1
Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings,"Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.",2025-08-08 22:16:57+00:00,2025-08-08 22:16:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06734v1
DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests,"We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (Rényi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $ε$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.",2025-08-08 15:09:13+00:00,2025-08-08 15:09:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06377v1
Adaptive Backtracking for Privacy Protection in Large Language Models,"The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.",2025-08-08 07:29:33+00:00,2025-08-08 07:29:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06087v1
A Game-Theoretic Foundation for Bitcoin's Price: A Security-Utility Equilibrium,"This paper introduces a structural game-theoretic model to value decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin. Instead of relying on speculative beliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point where the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry mining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The security, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined via a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and continuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer conditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the stabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially destabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable predictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate and price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test this mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional utility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed unidirectional causality from price to hash rate.",2025-08-11 01:48:49+00:00,2025-08-08 07:09:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06071v2
Fact2Fiction: Targeted Poisoning Attack to Agentic Fact-checking System,"State-of-the-art (SOTA) fact-checking systems combat misinformation by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanations for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers can amplify misinformation, but remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a novel threat model against such fact-checking systems and presents \textsc{Fact2Fiction}, the first poisoning attack framework targeting SOTA agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction employs LLMs to mimic the decomposition strategy and exploit system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification.

Secure and Scalable Blockchain Voting: A Comparative Framework and the Role of Large Language Models,"Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting systems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment.

Optimizing IoT Threat Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs),"The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of substantial security concerns, with IoT networks becoming the primary target for cyberattacks. This study examines the potential of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to conventional machine learning models for intrusion detection in IoT networks.

PRvL: Quantifying the Capabilities and Risks of Large Language Models for PII Redaction,"Redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured text is critical for ensuring data privacy in regulated domains. While earlier approaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and contexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction performance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in tasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction of PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation, LLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the consequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as privacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM architectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction. Our analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII leakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost. The results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that are accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and real-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned models, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built entirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for flexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for different domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments. This enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party services or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure.",2025-08-07 16:22:49+00:00,2025-08-07 16:22:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05545v1

An Overview of 7726 User Reports: Uncovering SMS Scams and Scammer Strategies,"Mobile network operators implement firewalls to stop illicit messages, but scammers find ways to evade detection. Previous work has looked into SMS texts that are blocked by these firewalls. However, there is little insight into SMS texts that bypass them and reach users. To this end, we collaborate with a major mobile network operator to receive 1.35m user reports submitted over four months. We find 89.16% of user reports comprise text messages, followed by reports of suspicious calls and URLs. Using our methodological framework, we identify 35.12% of the unique text messages reported by users as spam, while 40.27% are scam text messages. This is the first paper that investigates SMS reports submitted by users and differentiates between spam and scams. Our paper classifies the identified scam text messages into 12 scam types, of which the most popular is 'wrong number' scams. We explore the various infrastructure services that scammers abuse to conduct SMS scams, including mobile network operators and hosting infrastructure, and analyze the text of the scam messages to understand how scammers lure victims into providing them with their personal or financial details.",2025-11-10 12:15:59+00:00,2025-08-07 11:19:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05276v2
Necessity of Block Designs for Optimal Locally Private Distribution Estimation,"Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem. However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal. We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block designs.",2025-08-07 07:44:04+00:00,2025-08-07 07:44:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05110v1
On the Classical Hardness of the Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem in Finite Groups,"The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was proposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the belief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However, recent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum algorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental question: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard discrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work, we investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group platforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical algorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity $O(\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we demonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent and does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in elliptic curves $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded automorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the SDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue structure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian structure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased classical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems for cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the underlying algebraic structures.",2025-11-03 09:05:05+00:00,2025-08-07 05:59:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05048v2
System Security Framework for 5G Advanced /6G IoT Integrated Terrestrial Network-Non-Terrestrial Network (TN-NTN) with AI-Enabled Cloud Security,"The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), including 5G Advanced/6G and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPS), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is redefining the landscape of global connectivity. This paper introduces a new system-level security framework for 5G Advanced/6G IoT-integrated TN-NTN architectures with AI-native-enabled cloud security. Due to the heterogeneity, scale, and distributed nature of these networks, new security challenges have emerged. Leveraging AI-native cloud platforms offers powerful capabilities for real-time threat detection, security automation, and intelligent policy enforcement. The NTN satellite access function enhances security for discontinuous coverage via satellite connections. In addition, this paper explores the security risks associated with integrated 5G Advanced/6G IoT TN-NTN systems, including full network segmentation, network slicing, and the cloudification of the RAN and core. We present a comprehensive AI-enabled cloud security framework and conclude with proposals for implementing AI-powered, satellite-based NTN within future 5G Advanced/6G IoT networks.

Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graph-aware Large Language Models (LLMs),"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.",2025-08-06 21:38:52+00:00,2025-08-06 21:38:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04894v1
A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx,"Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies, however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data, resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare data.",2025-08-06 20:47:50+00:00,2025-08-06 20:47:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017v1
Log2Sig: Frequency-Aware Insider Threat Detection via Multivariate Behavioral Signal Decomposition,"Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.",2025-08-06 18:47:26+00:00,2025-08-06 18:47:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05696v1
MambaITD: An Efficient Cross-Modal Mamba Network for Insider Threat Detection,"Enterprises are facing increasing risks of insider threats, while existing detection methods are unable to effectively address these challenges due to reasons such as insufficient temporal dynamic feature modeling, computational efficiency and real-time bottlenecks and cross-modal information island problem. This paper proposes a new insider threat detection framework MambaITD based on the Mamba state space model and cross-modal adaptive fusion. First, the multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through behavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature extraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in behavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical information dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism. Finally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on maximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision threshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies anomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift. Compared with traditional methods, MambaITD shows significant advantages in modeling efficiency and feature fusion capabilities, outperforming Transformer-based methods, and provides a more effective solution for insider threat detection.",2025-08-06 18:45:00+00:00,2025-08-06 18:45:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05695v1
DMFI: Dual-Modality Fine-Tuning and Inference Framework for LLM-Based Insider Threat Detection,"Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts (e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.",2025-08-06 18:44:40+00:00,2025-08-06 18:44:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05694v1
Millions of inequivalent quadratic APN functions in eight variables,"The only known example of an almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutation in even dimension was obtained by applying CCZ-equivalence to a specific quadratic APN function. Motivated by this result, there have been numerous recent attempts to construct new quadratic APN functions. Currently, 32,892 quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 are known and two recent conjectures address their possible total number. The first, proposed by Y. Yu and L. Perrin (Cryptogr. Commun. 14(6): 1359-1369, 2022), suggests that there are more than 50,000 such functions. The second, by A. Polujan and A. Pott (Proc. 7th Int. Workshop on Boolean Functions and Their Applications, 2022), argues that their number exceeds that of inequivalent quadratic (8,4)-bent functions, which is 92,515. We computationally construct 3,775,599 inequivalent quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 and estimate the total number to be about 6 million.",2025-08-06 17:08:13+00:00,2025-08-06 17:08:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04644v1
4-Swap: Achieving Grief-Free and Bribery-Safe Atomic Swaps Using Four Transactions,"Cross-chain asset exchange is crucial for blockchain interoperability. Existing solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use decentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks. Griefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's assets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by introducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of transactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn introduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five transactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However, no existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four transactions.   This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that is both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just four transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a single transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to faster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions. It is fully compatible with Bitcoin and operates without the need for any new opcodes. A game-theoretic analysis shows that rational participants have no incentive to deviate from the protocol, ensuring robust compliance and security.",2025-08-06 17:06:55+00:00,2025-08-06 17:06:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04641v1
DP-DocLDM: Differentially Private Document Image Generation using Latent Diffusion Models,"As deep learning-based, data-driven information extraction systems become increasingly integrated into modern document processing workflows, one primary concern is the risk of malicious leakage of sensitive private data from these systems. While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to mitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant performance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training procedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult and costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the context of document image classification by substituting real private data with a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier following standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under various pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and layout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training strategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with DPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known document benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can generate useful and realistic document samples across various document types and privacy levels ($\varepsilon \in \{1, 5, 10\}$). Lastly, we show that our approach achieves substantial performance improvements in downstream evaluations on small-scale datasets, compared to the direct application of DP-Adam.",2025-08-06 08:43:08+00:00,2025-08-06 08:43:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04208v1
Eliciting and Analyzing Emergent Misalignment in State-of-the-Art Large Language Models,"Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception, value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation in future AI systems.",2025-08-06 08:25:40+00:00,2025-08-06 08:25:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04196v1

The findings highlight the critical need for stronger safeguards against identity theft in peer review and academia at large, and to this end, we also propose mitigating strategies.",2025-08-06 02:36:52+00:00,2025-08-06 02:36:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04024v1
Reputation-based partition scheme for IoT security,"With the popularity of smart terminals, such as the Internet of Things, crowdsensing is an emerging data aggregation paradigm, which plays a pivotal role in data-driven applications. There are some key issues in the development of crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the crowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized management will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues. To solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is proposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition size by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several disjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the appropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each partition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed node is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network periodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition transactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation protocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition transactions. Finally, experiments show that RSPC improves scalability, low latency, and high throughput for crowdsensing.",2025-08-06 00:27:59+00:00,2025-08-06 00:27:59+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03981v1
RAVID: Retrieval-Augmented Visual Detection: A Knowledge-Driven Approach for AI-Generated Image Identification,"In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%. RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",2025-08-05 23:10:56+00:00,2025-08-05 23:10:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03967v1
ASTRA: Autonomous Spatial-Temporal Red-teaming for AI Software Assistants,"AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.",2025-08-05 21:57:52+00:00,2025-08-05 21:57:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03936v1
Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models,"The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.",2025-08-05 18:19:00+00:00,2025-08-05 18:19:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829v1
AttnTrace: Attention-based Context Traceback for Long-Context LLMs,"Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents. In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews. The code is at https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/AttnTrace.",2025-08-05 17:56:51+00:00,2025-08-05 17:56:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03793v1
Selection-Based Vulnerabilities: Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in Active Learning,"Active learning(AL), which serves as the representative label-efficient learning paradigm, has been widely applied in resource-constrained scenarios. The achievement of AL is attributed to acquisition functions, which are designed for identifying the most important data to label. Despite this success, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we introduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition function as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active learning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit high uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by acquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across three datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label backdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates (up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model utility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind active learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and active learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios.",2025-08-05 15:59:19+00:00,2025-08-05 15:59:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05681v1
Intrusion Detection in Heterogeneous Networks with Domain-Adaptive Multi-Modal Learning,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a crucial role in safeguarding network infrastructure against cyberattacks. As the prevalence and sophistication of these attacks increase, machine learning and deep neural network approaches have emerged as effective tools for enhancing NIDS capabilities in detecting malicious activities. However, the effectiveness of traditional deep neural models is often limited by the need for extensive labelled datasets and the challenges posed by data and feature heterogeneity across different network domains. To address these limitations, we developed a deep neural model that integrates multi-modal learning with domain adaptation techniques for classification. Our model processes data from diverse sources in a sequential cyclic manner, allowing it to learn from multiple datasets and adapt to varying feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms baseline neural models in classifying network intrusions, particularly under conditions of varying sample availability and probability distributions. The model's performance highlights its ability to generalize across heterogeneous datasets, making it an efficient solution for real-world network intrusion detection.",2025-08-05 14:46:03+00:00,2025-08-05 14:46:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03517v1
Smart Car Privacy: Survey of Attacks and Privacy Issues,Automobiles are becoming increasingly important in our day to day life. Modern automobiles are highly computerized and hence potentially vulnerable to attack. Providing many wireless connectivity for vehicles enables a bridge between vehicles and their external environments. Such a connected vehicle solution is expected to be the next frontier for automotive revolution and the key to the evolution to next generation intelligent transportation systems. Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging mobile ad hoc network technologies incorporating mobile routing protocols for inter-vehicle data communications to support intelligent transportation systems. Thus security and privacy are the major concerns in VANETs due to the mobility of the vehicles. Thus designing security mechanisms to remove adversaries from the network remarkably important in VANETs.   This paper provides an overview of various vehicular network architectures.

From Legacy to Standard: LLM-Assisted Transformation of Cybersecurity Playbooks into CACAO Format,"Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous, non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models, combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.",2025-08-05 11:43:54+00:00,2025-08-05 11:43:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03342v1
BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.",2025-08-20 08:11:26+00:00,2025-08-05 08:48:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221v3
Principle-Guided Verilog Optimization: IP-Safe Knowledge Transfer via Local-Cloud Collaboration,"Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs (e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that balances performance gains with IP protection.",2025-08-05 07:50:55+00:00,2025-08-05 07:50:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05675v1
Protecting Small Organizations from AI Bots with Logrip: Hierarchical IP Hashing,"Small organizations, start ups, and self-hosted servers face increasing strain from automated web crawlers and AI bots, whose online presence has increased dramatically in the past few years. Modern bots evade traditional throttling and can degrade server performance through sheer volume even when they are well-behaved. We introduce a novel security approach that leverages data visualization and hierarchical IP hashing to analyze server event logs, distinguishing human users from automated entities based on access patterns. By aggregating IP activity across subnet classes and applying statistical measures, our method detects coordinated bot activity and distributed crawling attacks that conventional tools fail to identify. Using a real world example we estimate that 80 to 95 percent of traffic originates from AI crawlers, underscoring the need for improved filtering mechanisms. Our approach enables small organizations to regulate automated traffic effectively, preserving public access while mitigating performance degradation.",2025-08-05 06:22:30+00:00,2025-08-05 06:22:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03130v1
Lightweight Fault Detection Architecture for NTT on FPGA,"Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms are mathematically secure and resistant to quantum attacks but can still leak sensitive information in hardware implementations due to natural faults or intentional fault injections. The intent fault injection in side-channel attacks reduces the reliability of crypto implementation in future generation network security procesors. In this regard, this research proposes a lightweight, efficient, recomputation-based fault detection module implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The NTT is primarily composed of memory units and the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU), a critical and computationally intensive hardware component essential for polynomial multiplication. NTT and polynomial multiplication are fundamental building blocks in many PQC algorithms, including Kyber, NTRU, Ring-LWE, and others. In this paper, we present a fault detection method called : Recomputation with a Modular Offset (REMO) for the logic blocks of the CT-BU using Montgomery Reduction and another method called Memory Rule Checkers for the memory components used within the NTT. The proposed fault detection framework sets a new benchmark by achieving high efficiency with significant low implementation cost. It occupies only 16 slices and a single DSP block, with a power consumption of just 3mW in Artix-7 FPGA. The REMO-based detection mechanism achieves a fault coverage of 87.2% to 100%, adaptable across various word sizes, fault bit counts, and fault injection modes. Similarly, the Memory Rule Checkers demonstrate robust performance, achieving 50.7% to 100% fault detection depending on and the nature of injected faults.",2025-08-05 04:23:50+00:00,2025-08-05 04:23:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03062v1
PrivAR: Real-Time Privacy Protection for Location-Based Augmented Reality Applications,"Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pokémon Go, stream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user experiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious privacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging than in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time location protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy guaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS). Existing methods fail to meet these combined demands.   To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework for real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar Staircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to generate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected error; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme that releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a private threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level privacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive experiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and validate PrivAR on a Pokémon-Go-style prototype. Results show PrivAR improves QoS (Gamescore) by up to 50%, while increasing attacker error by 1.8x over baseline with an additional 0.06 milliseconds runtime overhead.",2025-08-04 16:02:10+00:00,2025-08-04 16:02:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02551v1
Nicknames for Group Signatures,"Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) is a new signature scheme that extends Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS, each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.   To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model. As a practical NGS use case, we build NickHat, a blockchain-based token-exchange prototype system on top of Ethereum.",2025-10-17 08:19:43+00:00,2025-08-04 15:53:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02543v2
SoftPUF: a Software-Based Blockchain Framework using PUF and Machine Learning,"Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) offers a secure and lightweight alternative to traditional cryptography for authentication due to their unique device fingerprint. However, their dependence on specialized hardware hinders their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF. SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in diverse blockchain-based applications. Additionally, to ensure robust security, the system incorporates well-established defense mechanisms against various attacks, including 51%, phishing, routing, and Sybil attacks, into the blockchain network.

Analysis of Publicly Accessible Operational Technology and Associated Risks,"Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation. However, OT networks, systems, and devices have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides an up-to-date overview of the OT threat landscape exposed to the public internet and studies the affected protocols, vendors, software, and the geographic distribution of systems. Our findings reveal nearly 70,000 exposed OT devices globally, with significant concentrations in North America and Europe. Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7) shows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including outdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain unpatched for years after disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how automated analysis of screenshots can uncover exposed graphical interfaces of Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, highlighting diverse pathways for potential unauthorized access and underscoring the risks to industrial processes and critical infrastructure.",2025-08-04 13:03:38+00:00,2025-08-04 13:03:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02375v1
Can LLMs effectively provide game-theoretic-based scenarios for cybersecurity?,"Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.",2025-08-04 08:57:14+00:00,2025-08-04 08:57:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05670v1
Robust Detection of Planted Subgraphs in Semi-Random Models,"Detection of planted subgraphs in Erdös-Rényi random graphs has been extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary, despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and open new directions in the study of semi-random models, computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference problems.",2025-08-04 07:59:42+00:00,2025-08-04 07:59:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02158v1
Coward: Toward Practical Proactive Federated Backdoor Defense via Collision-based Watermark,"Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories, including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data) while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The code for our method would be available at https://github.com/still2009/cowardFL.",2025-08-04 06:51:33+00:00,2025-08-04 06:51:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02115v1
FPEdit: Robust LLM Fingerprinting through Localized Parameter Editing,"Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data, and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off: intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel framework that leverages knowledge editing to inject semantically coherent natural language fingerprints through sparse, targeted modifications to model weights. Our approach introduces Promote-Suppress Value Vector Optimization, which simultaneously enhances target token likelihood while suppressing competing tokens, ensuring robust fingerprint integration without degrading core model functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves 95-100% fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on downstream benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under 2 minutes using less than 30 GB of GPU memory, which represents a substantial reduction in resource requirements. These advances establish FPEdit as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility, thereby providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.",2025-10-17 08:53:43+00:00,2025-08-04 06:00:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02092v2
PhishParrot: LLM-Driven Adaptive Crawling to Unveil Cloaked Phishing Sites,"Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A 21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to 33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.",2025-08-04 04:04:07+00:00,2025-08-04 04:04:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02035v1

These characteristics fundamentally undermine conventional security methods and traditional artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. Generative AI (GAI) is a transformative approach that can safeguard SAGIN security by synthesizing data, understanding semantics, and making autonomous decisions. This survey fills existing review gaps by examining GAI-empowered secure communications across SAGINs.

A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology,"Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications, increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.",2025-08-03 20:26:19+00:00,2025-08-03 20:26:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01913v1

The prominent variants, Satori, Mukashi, Moobot, and Sonic1, together target more than 15 unique known vulnerabilities discovered between 2014-2021. The vulnerabilities include but are not limited to improper input validation, command injections, insufficient credential protection, and out-of-bound writes. With these new attack strategies, Satori compromised more than a quarter million devices within the first twelve hours of its release and peaked at almost 700,000 infected devices. Similarly, Mukashi made more than a hundred million Zyxel NAS devices vulnerable through its new exploits. This article reviews the attack methodologies and impacts of these variants in detail.

Optimizing Day-Ahead Energy Trading with Proximal Policy Optimization and Blockchain,"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability, and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical deployment.",2025-08-03 18:45:17+00:00,2025-08-03 18:45:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01888v1
A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Computing in the Automotive Domain,"As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, they accumulate and manage various personal data, thereby presenting a key challenge in preserving privacy during data sharing and processing. This survey reviews applications of Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) that address these privacy concerns in the automotive domain. First, we identify the scope of privacy-sensitive use cases for these technologies, by surveying existing works that address privacy issues in different automotive contexts, such as location-based services, mobility infrastructures, traffic management, etc. Then, we review recent works that employ MPC and HE as solutions for these use cases in detail. Our survey highlights the applicability of these privacy-preserving technologies in the automotive context, while also identifying challenges and gaps in the current research landscape. This work aims to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of this emerging field and to encourage further research in this domain.",2025-08-03 15:23:41+00:00,2025-08-03 15:23:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01798v1
RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in Routing-based Model Merging,"Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.",2025-08-03 14:51:58+00:00,2025-08-03 14:51:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01784v1
"""Energon"": Unveiling Transformers from GPU Power and Thermal Side-Channels","Transformers have become the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML) applications, including language translation, summarization, and computer vision. As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks that reveal architectural details without physical access remains underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target. This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel leakage in deployed transformer models.",2025-08-03 14:08:15+00:00,2025-08-03 14:08:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01768v1
LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations,"Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse protocols and implementations.   We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations. Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.",2025-08-03 13:16:18+00:00,2025-08-03 13:16:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750v1
Performance and Storage Analysis of CRYSTALS Kyber as a Post Quantum Replacement for RSA and ECC,"The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022, represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications, utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration capabilities.",2025-08-30 14:52:50+00:00,2025-08-03 09:53:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01694v5
Benchmarking Adversarial Patch Selection and Location,"Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models. We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as 2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to 13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.",2025-08-03 09:07:19+00:00,2025-08-03 09:07:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01676v1
JSidentify-V2: Leveraging Dynamic Memory Fingerprinting for Mini-Game Plagiarism Detection,"The explosive growth of mini-game platforms has led to widespread code plagiarism, where malicious users access popular games' source code and republish them with modifications. While existing static analysis tools can detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.   We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...",2025-08-03 08:26:13+00:00,2025-08-03 08:26:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01655v1
Privacy-Preserving Inference for Quantized BERT Models,"With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services, ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$ speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott \emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).",2025-08-03 07:52:08+00:00,2025-08-03 07:52:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01636v1
Are All Prompt Components Value-Neutral? Understanding the Heterogeneous Adversarial Robustness of Dissected Prompt in Large Language Models,"Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb. To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.",2025-08-03 02:46:30+00:00,2025-08-03 02:46:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01554v1
Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics,"We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.",2025-08-02 20:19:22+00:00,2025-08-02 20:19:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01479v1
VWAttacker: A Systematic Security Testing Framework for Voice over WiFi User Equipments,"We present VWAttacker, the first systematic testing framework for analyzing the security of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) User Equipment (UE) implementations. VWAttacker includes a complete VoWiFi network testbed that communicates with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs based on a simple interface to test the behavior of diverse VoWiFi UE implementations; uses property-guided adversarial testing to uncover security issues in different UEs systematically. To reduce manual effort in extracting and testing properties, we introduce an LLM-based, semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC) generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering the security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all the related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has been acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.",2025-08-02 19:37:57+00:00,2025-08-02 19:37:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01469v1
Nakamoto Consensus from Multiple Resources,"The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a VDF).   In this paper, we ask what weight functions Γ(S,V,W) (that assign a weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain is secure against private double-spending attacks.   We completely classify such functions in an idealized ""continuous"" model: Γ(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e., αΓ(S,V,W)=Γ(S,αV, αW). This includes Bitcoin rule Γ(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule Γ(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).   Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization, say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using {\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue that in practice these are much better choices.",2025-08-02 17:36:50+00:00,2025-08-02 17:36:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01448v1
AI-Driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection: Building Resilient Defense Systems Using Predictive Analytics,"This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and mitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat analysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features. These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.",2025-08-02 16:03:35+00:00,2025-08-02 16:03:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01422v1
Prompt to Pwn: Automated Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts,"We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation (AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite, enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness, including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support future research.",2025-08-02 13:52:15+00:00,2025-08-02 13:52:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01371v1
NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM,"Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.",2025-08-02 12:56:27+00:00,2025-08-02 12:56:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351v1
MultiCFV: Detecting Control Flow Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts Leveraging Multimodal Deep Learning,"The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy, and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features. Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection and clone detection.",2025-08-02 12:49:41+00:00,2025-08-02 12:49:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01346v1
UEChecker: Detecting Unchecked External Call Vulnerabilities in DApps via Graph Analysis,"The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.",2025-08-02 12:40:17+00:00,2025-08-02 12:40:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01343v1

CP-FREEZER: Latency Attacks against Vehicular Cooperative Perception,"Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents. While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges, including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline. Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100% success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed.

Unveiling Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Techniques,"Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) is the set of techniques that enable instrumentation of programs at run-time, making it possible to monitor and modify the execution of compiled binaries or entire systems. DBI is used for countless security applications and analyses, and is extensively used across many fields in both industry and academia. Over the years, several DBI approaches have been proposed based on different technologies and implementing diverse techniques. Every solution tries to overcome certain limitations, but they sometimes bring other shortcomings. Some are specialized for one particular domain or task, while others have a wider scope.   In this paper, we shed light into the labyrinth of DBI, bringing together process-level and whole-system approaches. We depict their building blocks and analyze the underlying instrumentation techniques, comparing their ability to instrument different primitives and run-time events. Then, we evaluate their performance when implementing each primitive, and highlight relevant observations. Our results show that no single technique is better than the rest in all circumstances.",2025-08-01 14:53:03+00:00,2025-08-01 14:53:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00682v1
LeakSealer: A Semisupervised Defense for LLMs Against Prompt Injection and Leakage Attacks,"The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.",2025-08-01 13:04:28+00:00,2025-08-01 13:04:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00602v1
Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems,"Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.",2025-08-01 12:45:30+00:00,2025-08-01 12:45:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591v1
CIF: A Constrained Inversion Framework for Reliable Message Extraction in Diffusion-Based Generative Steganography,"Generative image steganography aims to conceal secret information in generated images without arousing suspicion. However, in practical scenarios involving high-capacity embedding or lossy transmission, existing methods still suffer from limited extraction accuracy. The main challenge lies in accurately recovering the secret-embedded latent vectors from stego images. To address this issue, we propose CIF, a constrained inversion framework designed to achieve accurate message extraction. Specifically, CIF reduces dynamic structural errors by enforcing linear consistency in the latent space, meanwhile reduces numerical integration errors by adaptively adjusting the integration order according to local trajectory stability. Experimental results show that our method reduces latent reconstruction error by more than 35\% and achieves higher message extraction accuracy than existing approaches.",2025-11-24 07:38:06+00:00,2025-08-01 08:46:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00434v2
Cryptanalysis of Isogeny-Based Quantum Money with Rational Points,"Quantum money is the cryptographic application of the quantum no-cloning theorem. It has recently been instantiated by Montgomery and Sharif (Asiacrypt '24) from class group actions on elliptic curves. In this work, we propose a concrete cryptanalysis by leveraging the efficiency of evaluating division polynomials with the coordinates of rational points, offering a speedup of O(log^4p) compared to the brute-force attack. Since our attack still requires exponential time, it remains impractical to forge a quantum banknote. Interestingly, due to the inherent properties of quantum money, our attack method also results in a more efficient verification procedure. Our algorithm leverages the properties of quadratic twists to utilize rational points in verifying the cardinality of the superposition of elliptic curves. We expect this approach to contribute to future research on elliptic-curve-based quantum cryptography.",2025-08-01 06:35:26+00:00,2025-08-01 06:35:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00351v1
LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.",2025-10-31 11:55:42+00:00,2025-07-31 15:19:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943v2
Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark Challenge,"The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted.   The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.",2025-07-31 14:47:20+00:00,2025-07-31 14:47:20+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23608v1
Scalable contribution bounding to achieve privacy,"In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total contribution. This ""contribution bounding"" becomes a significant combinatorial challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph, where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large, real-world systems.",2025-07-31 11:14:17+00:00,2025-07-31 11:14:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23432v1
Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents,"Computer-using agents (CUAs), which can autonomously control computers to perform multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LMs in chatbots or simple tool use. To more comprehensively evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling firewalls, leaking data, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox with rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), beyond refusal rates. We evaluate frontier LMs including GPT-5, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2. Even without jailbreaking prompts, these frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate (e.g., 90\% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, while newer models are safer in previous safety benchmarks, their misuse risks as CUAs become even higher, e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro is riskier than Gemini 1.5 Pro. Additionally, while these LMs are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) when acting as chatbots, they could still act unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it also amplifies misuse risks. To mitigate the misuse risks of CUAs, we explore using LMs to monitor CUAs' actions. We find monitoring unsafe computer-using actions is significantly harder than monitoring conventional unsafe chatbot responses. While monitoring chain-of-thoughts leads to modest gains, the average monitoring accuracy is only 77\%. A hierarchical summarization strategy improves performance by up to 13\%, a promising direction though monitoring remains unreliable. The benchmark will be released publicly to facilitate further research on mitigating these risks.",2025-09-24 06:08:42+00:00,2025-07-31 07:02:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935v2
How Cybersecurity Behaviors affect the Success of Darknet Drug Vendors: A Quantitative Analysis,"Understanding behavioral drivers of success in illicit digital marketplaces is critical for developing effective enforcement strategies and understanding digital commerce evolution, as darknet drug markets represent a growing share of the total drug economy. This study employs quantitative regression analysis of 50,000+ listings from 2,653 vendors in the Agora marketplace (2014-2015), examining relationships between cybersecurity signaling (PGP encryption mentions), product diversification, and commercial success through nested regression specifications controlling for reputation, pricing, and category-specific factors. Product diversification emerges as the dominant predictor of vendor scale, increasing the odds of large vendor status by 169% per additional category, while PGP encryption signaling functions primarily as a professional marker rather than an independent success factor. Vendor success depends on portfolio breadth rather than specialization, with category-specific enforcement creating differential market constraints. Successful vendors operate as diversified enterprises capable of rapid pivoting between product categories, requiring targeted enforcement towards diversified vendors based on coordinated multi-category enforcement approaches rather than traditional substance-specific targeting strategies.",2025-07-31 05:45:07+00:00,2025-07-31 05:45:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00934v1
Cryptanalysis of LC-MUME: A Lightweight Certificateless Multi-User Matchmaking Encryption for Mobile Devices,"Yang et al. proposed a lightweight certificateless multiuser matchmaking encryption (LC-MUME) scheme for mobile devices, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS) (DOI: 10.1109/TIFS.2023.3321961). Their construction aims to reduce computational and communication overhead within a one-to-many certificateless cryptographic framework. The authors claim that their scheme satisfies existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the random oracle model. However, our cryptanalytic study demonstrates that the scheme fails to meet this critical security requirement. In particular, we show that a Type-I adversary can successfully forge a valid ciphertext without possessing the complete private key of the sender. Both theoretical analysis and practical implementation confirm that this attack can be mounted with minimal computational cost. To address these weaknesses, we propose a modification strategy to strengthen the security of matchmaking encryption schemes in mobile computing environments.",2025-07-30 13:36:52+00:00,2025-07-30 13:36:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22674v1
SAEL: Leveraging Large Language Models with Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection,"With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information, contributing to improved detection performance.   Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.",2025-07-30 04:28:00+00:00,2025-07-30 04:28:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22371v1
Benchmarking Fraud Detectors on Private Graph Data,"We introduce the novel problem of benchmarking fraud detectors on private graph-structured data. Currently, many types of fraud are managed in part by automated detection algorithms that operate over graphs. We consider the scenario where a data holder wishes to outsource development of fraud detectors to third parties (e.g., vendors or researchers). The third parties submit their fraud detectors to the data holder, who evaluates these algorithms on a private dataset and then publicly communicates the results. We propose a realistic privacy attack on this system that allows an adversary to de-anonymize individuals' data based only on the evaluation results. In simulations of a privacy-sensitive benchmark for facial recognition algorithms by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), our attack achieves near perfect accuracy in identifying whether individuals' data is present in a private dataset, with a True Positive Rate of 0.98 at a False Positive Rate of 0.00. We then study how to benchmark algorithms while satisfying a formal differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We empirically evaluate two classes of solutions: subsample-and-aggregate and DP synthetic graph data. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that current approaches do not provide utility when guaranteeing DP. Our results indicate that the error arising from DP trades off between bias from distorting graph structure and variance from adding random noise. Current methods lie on different points along this bias-variance trade-off, but more complex methods tend to require high-variance noise addition, undermining utility.",2025-07-30 03:20:15+00:00,2025-07-30 03:20:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22347v1
"Whisper Smarter, not Harder: Adversarial Attack on Partial Suppression","Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.",2025-09-08 03:30:40+00:00,2025-07-30 02:02:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09994v2
SleepWalk: Exploiting Context Switching and Residual Power for Physical Side-Channel Attacks,"Context switching is utilized by operating systems to change the execution context between application programs. It involves saving and restoring the states of multiple registers and performing a pipeline flush to remove any pre-fetched instructions, leading to a higher instantaneous power consumption compared to typical program execution. In this paper, we introduce a physical power side-channel leakage source that exploits the power spike observed during a context switch, triggered by the inbuilt sleep function of the system kernel. We observed that this power spike directly correlates with both the power consumption during context switching and the residual power consumption of the previously executed program. Notably, the persistence of residual power signatures from previous workloads extends the scope of this side-channel beyond extracting the data in registers during the context switch. Unlike traditional approaches that require analyzing full power traces, applying complex preprocessing, or relying on external synchronization triggers, this novel technique leverages only the amplitude of a single power spike, significantly simplifying the attack. We developed a power model to illustrate the feasibility of mounting end-to-end side-channel attacks using the sleep-induced power spikes. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our framework can successfully perform cryptographic key recovery for both AES and SIKE implementations on Broadcom BCM2711.",2025-07-30 00:39:27+00:00,2025-07-30 00:39:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22306v1
Cell-Probe Lower Bounds via Semi-Random CSP Refutation: Simplified and the Odd-Locality Case,"A recent work (Korten, Pitassi, and Impagliazzo, FOCS 2025) established an insightful connection between static data structure lower bounds, range avoidance of $\text{NC}^0$ circuits, and the refutation of pseudorandom CSP instances, leading to improvements to some longstanding lower bounds in the cell-probe/bit-probe models. Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et al.   As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient independence, and further this can be efficiently certified. Via suitable shifts in perspectives, this gives applications to cell-probe lower bounds and range avoidance algorithms for $\mathsf{NC}^0$ circuits.",2025-07-29 22:33:09+00:00,2025-07-29 22:33:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22265v1
Predictive Auditing of Hidden Tokens in LLM APIs via Reasoning Length Estimation,"Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing, yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g., hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing, offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user trust.",2025-07-29 19:50:55+00:00,2025-07-29 19:50:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00912v1
Strategic Deflection: Defending LLMs from Logit Manipulation,"With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas, ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced threats.",2025-07-29 18:46:56+00:00,2025-07-29 18:46:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22160v1
Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers,"This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of a larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.",2025-08-08 15:18:21+00:00,2025-07-29 18:14:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22140v2
Prompt Optimization and Evaluation for LLM Automated Red Teaming,"Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread, making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important. Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization, ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.",2025-07-29 18:08:01+00:00,2025-07-29 18:08:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22133v1
ZIUM: Zero-Shot Intent-Aware Adversarial Attack on Unlearned Models,"Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation. Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for previously attacked unlearned concepts.",2025-07-29 16:36:01+00:00,2025-07-29 16:36:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21985v1

Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis,"Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.",2025-09-25 19:46:49+00:00,2025-07-29 08:46:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591v2
PRISM: Programmatic Reasoning with Image Sequence Manipulation for LVLM Jailbreaking,"The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the entire reasoning process.",2025-07-29 07:13:56+00:00,2025-07-29 07:13:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21540v1
NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples,"Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust.",2025-08-06 14:54:25+00:00,2025-07-29 03:58:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21483v2
Cascading and Proxy Membership Inference Attacks,"A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance.   In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.",2025-09-07 16:50:02+00:00,2025-07-29 00:46:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21412v3
On Post-Quantum Cryptography Authentication for Quantum Key Distribution,"The traditional way for a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) user to join a quantum network is by authenticating themselves using pre-shared key material. While this approach is sufficient for small-scale networks, it becomes impractical as the network grows, due to the total quadratic increase in the number of pre-shared keys required. To address this scalability issue, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) combined with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers a more scalable solution, allowing users to authenticate the QKD traffic remotely to obtain information-theoretical secure (ITS) keys under the presented assumptions. Unlike traditional PKI, which relies on classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, the approach presented in this paper leverages PQC algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Similarly to the SIGMA or TLS protocols, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity are achievable against bounded adversaries to ensure secure and scalable quantum networks.",2025-07-28 20:40:11+00:00,2025-07-28 20:40:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21325v1
Repairing vulnerabilities without invisible hands. A differentiated replication study on LLMs,"Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code generation and fault detection.   Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- ""invisible hands"" such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.   Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because any offset should divert the model from the original fix.   Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth. A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.",2025-07-28 16:39:16+00:00,2025-07-28 16:39:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20977v1
Text2VLM: Adapting Text-Only Datasets to Evaluate Alignment Training in Visual Language Models,"The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.",2025-07-28 10:57:44+00:00,2025-07-28 10:57:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20704v1
Guard-GBDT: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Approximated GBDT Training on Vertical Dataset,"In light of increasing privacy concerns and stringent legal regulations, using secure multiparty computation (MPC) to enable collaborative GBDT model training among multiple data owners has garnered significant attention. Despite this, existing MPC-based GBDT frameworks face efficiency challenges due to high communication costs and the computation burden of non-linear operations, such as division and sigmoid calculations. In this work, we introduce Guard-GBDT, an innovative framework tailored for efficient and privacy-preserving GBDT training on vertical datasets. Guard-GBDT bypasses MPC-unfriendly division and sigmoid functions by using more streamlined approximations and reduces communication overhead by compressing the messages exchanged during gradient aggregation. We implement a prototype of Guard-GBDT and extensively evaluate its performance and accuracy on various real-world datasets. The results show that Guard-GBDT outperforms state-of-the-art HEP-XGB (CIKM'21) and SiGBDT (ASIA CCS'24) by up to $2.71\times$ and $12.21 \times$ on LAN network and up to $2.7\times$ and $8.2\times$ on WAN network. Guard-GBDT also achieves comparable accuracy with SiGBDT and plaintext XGBoost (better than HEP-XGB ), which exhibits a deviation of $\pm1\%$ to $\pm2\%$ only. Our implementation code is provided at https://github.com/XidianNSS/Guard-GBDT.git.",2025-07-28 10:16:37+00:00,2025-07-28 10:16:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20688v1
Program Analysis for High-Value Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Techniques and Insights,"A widespread belief in the blockchain security community is that automated techniques are only good for detecting shallow bugs, typically of small value. In this paper, we present the techniques and insights that have led us to repeatable success in automatically discovering high-value smart contract vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability disclosures have yielded 10 bug bounties, for a total of over $3M, over high-profile deployed code, as well as hundreds of bugs detected in pre-deployment or under-audit code.   We argue that the elements of this surprising success are a) a very high-completeness static analysis approach that manages to maintain acceptable precision; b) domain knowledge, provided by experts or captured via statistical inference. We present novel techniques for automatically inferring domain knowledge from statistical analysis of a large corpus of deployed contracts, as well as discuss insights on the ideal precision and warning rate of a promising vulnerability detector. In contrast to academic literature in program analysis, which routinely expects false-positive rates below 50% for publishable results, we posit that a useful analysis for high-value real-world vulnerabilities will likely flag very few programs (under 1%) and will do so with a high false-positive rate (e.g., 95%, meaning that only one-of-twenty human inspections will yield an exploitable vulnerability).",2025-07-28 09:53:31+00:00,2025-07-28 09:53:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20672v1
MPC-EVM: Enabling MPC Execution by Smart Contracts In An Asynchronous Manner,"This paper presents MPC-EVM, the first blockchain prototype that extends the EVM to enable asynchronous MPC invocations by smart contracts during transaction executions without compromising consistency or throughput. MPC-EVM uses an asynchronous execution model to process MPC-invoking transactions in a non-blocking fashion, saving the transaction's progress when it enters an MPC and resuming its execution upon MPC's completion. Additionally, it employs an access control mechanism that prevents inconsistent state access and modifications as a result of asynchronous executions. Benchmarking MPC-EVM's throughput show that the transactions per second (TPS) decreased by less than 3% compared to the baseline when MPC-invoking transactions are executed alongside regular transactions.",2025-07-28 06:39:17+00:00,2025-07-28 06:39:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20554v1
MaXsive: High-Capacity and Robust Training-Free Generative Image Watermarking in Diffusion Models,"The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks. Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID) collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of verification and identification.",2025-07-28 00:51:47+00:00,2025-07-28 00:51:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21195v1
Is Crunching Public Data the Right Approach to Detect BGP Hijacks?,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) remains a fragile pillar of Internet routing. BGP hijacks still occurr daily. While full deployment of Route Origin Validation (ROV) is ongoing, attackers have already adapted, launching post-ROV attacks such as forged-origin hijacks. To detect these, recent approaches like DFOH [Holterbach et al., USENIX NSDI '24] and BEAM [Chen et al., USENIX Security '24] apply machine learning (ML) to analyze data from globally distributed BGP monitors, assuming anomalies will stand out against historical patterns. However, this assumption overlooks a key threat: BGP monitors themselves can be misled by adversaries injecting bogus routes. This paper shows that state-of-the-art hijack detection systems like DFOH and BEAM are vulnerable to data poisoning. Using large-scale BGP simulations, we show that attackers can evade detection with just a handful of crafted announcements beyond the actual hijack. These announcements are indeed sufficient to corrupt the knowledge base used by ML-based defenses and distort the metrics they rely on. Our results highlight a worrying weakness of relying solely on public BGP data.",2025-07-27 22:35:21+00:00,2025-07-27 22:35:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20434v1
Interpretable Anomaly-Based DDoS Detection in AI-RAN with XAI and LLMs,"Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability, intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers, enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE) behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and interpretable outputs.",2025-07-27 22:16:09+00:00,2025-07-27 22:16:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21193v1
"Two Views, One Truth: Spectral and Self-Supervised Features Fusion for Robust Speech Deepfake Detection","Recent advances in synthetic speech have made audio deepfakes increasingly realistic, posing significant security risks. Existing detection methods that rely on a single modality, either raw waveform embeddings or spectral based features, are vulnerable to non spoof disturbances and often overfit to known forgery algorithms, resulting in poor generalization to unseen attacks. To address these shortcomings, we investigate hybrid fusion frameworks that integrate self supervised learning (SSL) based representations with handcrafted spectral descriptors (MFCC , LFCC, CQCC). By aligning and combining complementary information across modalities, these fusion approaches capture subtle artifacts that single feature approaches typically overlook. We explore several fusion strategies, including simple concatenation, cross attention, mutual cross attention, and a learnable gating mechanism, to optimally blend SSL features with fine grained spectral cues. We evaluate our approach on four challenging public benchmarks and report generalization performance. All fusion variants consistently outperform an SSL only baseline, with the cross attention strategy achieving the best generalization with a 38% relative reduction in equal error rate (EER). These results confirm that joint modeling of waveform and spectral views produces robust, domain agnostic representations for audio deepfake detection.",2025-07-27 21:22:27+00:00,2025-07-27 21:22:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20417v1
Measuring and Explaining the Effects of Android App Transformations in Online Malware Detection,"It is well known that antivirus engines are vulnerable to evasion techniques (e.g., obfuscation) that transform malware into its variants. However, it cannot be necessarily attributed to the effectiveness of these evasions, and the limits of engines may also make this unsatisfactory result. In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to measure the effect of app transformations to malware detection, and further explain why the detection result is produced by these engines. First, we develop an interaction model for antivirus engines, illustrating how they respond with different detection results in terms of varying inputs. Six app transformation techniques are implemented in order to generate a large number of Android apps with traceable changes. Then we undertake a one-month tracking of app detection results from multiple antivirus engines, through which we obtain over 971K detection reports from VirusTotal for 179K apps in total. Last, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of antivirus engines based on these reports from the perspectives of signature-based, static analysis-based, and dynamic analysis-based detection techniques. The results, together with 7 highlighted findings, identify a number of sealed working mechanisms occurring inside antivirus engines and what are the indicators of compromise in apps during malware detection.",2025-07-27 17:26:50+00:00,2025-07-27 17:26:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20361v1
SDD: Self-Degraded Defense against Malicious Fine-tuning,"Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's effectiveness against such attacks.",2025-07-27 02:08:21+00:00,2025-07-27 02:08:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21182v1
Product-Congruence Games: A Unified Impartial-Game Framework for RSA ($φ$-MuM) and AES (poly-MuM),"RSA exponent reduction and AES S-box inversion share a hidden commonality: both are governed by the same impartial combinatorial principle, which we call a Product-Congruence Game (PCG). A Product-Congruence Game tracks play via the modular or finite-field product of heap values, providing a single invariant that unifies the algebraic cores of these two ubiquitous symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. We instantiate this framework with two companion games. First, $φ$-MuM, in which a left-associated ""multi-secret"" RSA exponent chain compresses into the game of Multiplicative Modular Nim, PCG($k,\{1\}$), where $k = ord_N(g)$. The losing predicate then factorizes via the Chinese remainder theorem, mirroring RSA's structure. Second, poly-MuM, our model for finite-field inversion such as the AES S-box. For poly-MuM we prove the single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the Sprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region. Beyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general Product-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus, (ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing densities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy region. An operation-alignment collapse principle explains why some variants degenerate to a single aggregate while MuM, $φ$-MuM and poly-MuM retain rich local structure. All ingredients (multiplicative orders, the Chinese remainder theorem, finite fields) are classical; the contribution is the unified aggregation-compression viewpoint that embeds both RSA and AES inside one impartial-game framework, together with the structural and collapse theorems.",2025-07-27 00:29:13+00:00,2025-07-27 00:29:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20087v1
"Policy-Driven AI in Dataspaces: Taxonomy, Explainability, and Pathways for Compliant Innovation","As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative analytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for aligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We propose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels, performance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics -- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and Eclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives, this work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and compliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and responsible data-driven ecosystems.",2025-07-30 08:46:55+00:00,2025-07-26 17:07:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20014v2
"""Blockchain-Enabled Zero Trust Framework for Securing FinTech Ecosystems Against Insider Threats and Cyber Attacks""","Fintech provides technological services to increase operational efficiency in financial institutions, but traditional perimeter-based defense mechanisms are insufficient against evolving cyber threats like insider attacks, malware intrusions, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These vulnerabilities expose Fintech organizations to significant risks, including financial losses and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-integrated Zero Trust framework, adhering to the principle of ""Never Trust, Always Verify."" The framework uses Ethereum smart contracts to enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Just-In-Time (JIT) access privileges, effectively mitigating credential theft and insider threats, the effect of malware and APT attacks.   The proposed solution transforms blockchain into a Policy Engine (PE) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), and policy storage, ensuring immutable access control and micro-segmentation. A decentralized application (DApp) prototype was developed and tested using STRIDE threat modeling, demonstrating resilience against spoofing, tampering, and privilege escalation. Comparative analysis with Perimeter-based systems revealed a trade-off: while the framework introduced a marginal latency increase (74.0 ms vs. 49.33 ms) and reduced throughput (30.77 vs. 50.0 requests/sec), it significantly enhanced security by eliminating single points of failure and enabling tamper-proof audit trails.   Experimental validation on a 200-node simulated network confirmed the framework's robustness, with future optimizations targeting Layer-2 solutions for scalability. This work bridges the gap between Zero Trust theory and practical blockchain implementation, offering Fintech organizations a decentralized, cost-effective security model.",2025-07-26 15:21:04+00:00,2025-07-26 15:21:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19976v1
Trivial Trojans: How Minimal MCP Servers Enable Cross-Tool Exfiltration of Sensitive Data,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to secure this emerging ecosystem.",2025-07-26 09:22:40+00:00,2025-07-26 09:22:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19880v1
Polar Coding and Linear Decoding,"Polar encoding, described by Arikan in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 55, No. 7, July 2009, was a milestone for telecommunications. A Polar code distributes information among high and low-capacity channels, showing the possibility of achieving perfect channel capacity. The high-capacity channels allow almost noiseless transmission of data. When these channels are not high noise, reliability is achieved in the signal transmission. It starts to compete against codes such a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. Polar code can be also considered error correcting, based on the redundancy inherent in its structure. This feature makes polar encoding also applicable to digital quantum-resistant cryptography protocols. This work explores linear decoding at a first or single trial in the case of small losses or small number of bit-flipping, and repeated transmission for medium level losses. This is distinct from Arikans successive probabilistic decoding by application of probabilistic rules. Linear decoding is done directly from solving the linear equations connecting the codewords x and the received signals y after transmission via noisy channels. Numerical examples will be shown. Along with this work, programming in Mathematica language was used. Codes are available for copy-and-paste for Mathematica users to immediately try the described formalism.",2025-07-25 22:23:14+00:00,2025-07-25 22:23:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19695v1
OneShield -- the Next Generation of LLM Guardrails,"The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature of LLMs makes it extremely challenging to universally shield users against their potential risks, and one-size-fits-all solutions are unfeasible. In this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, discuss scalability considerations, and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its initial deployment.",2025-07-31 18:07:13+00:00,2025-07-25 19:44:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21170v2
MOCHA: Are Code Language Models Robust Against Multi-Turn Malicious Coding Prompts?,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks, where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open- and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any additional supervision.",2025-07-25 18:11:10+00:00,2025-07-25 18:11:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19598v1
SILS: Strategic Influence on Liquidity Stability and Whale Detection in Concentrated-Liquidity DEXs,"Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.",2025-07-25 16:21:18+00:00,2025-07-25 16:21:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19411v1
Running in CIRCLE? A Simple Benchmark for LLM Code Interpreter Security,"As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities, substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes explicitly malicious (""direct"") and plausibly benign (""indirect"") prompt variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools (e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.",2025-07-25 16:06:16+00:00,2025-07-25 16:06:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19399v1
Empowering IoT Firmware Secure Update with Customization Rights,"Firmware updates remain the primary line of defense for IoT devices; however, the update channel itself has become a well-established attack vector. Existing defenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving module-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the update workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering five previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices. A broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over half originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a critical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the attack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP (Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two key challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and scaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three techniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side proof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to reuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows that even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image incurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation time by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a package-manager baseline.",2025-07-25 15:17:29+00:00,2025-07-25 15:17:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19367v1
How Much Do Large Language Model Cheat on Evaluation? Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework,"Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments. Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography. ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii) Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of current LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.",2025-07-25 12:39:03+00:00,2025-07-25 12:39:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219v1
PrompTrend: Continuous Community-Driven Vulnerability Discovery and Assessment for Large Language Models,"Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.",2025-07-25 11:52:46+00:00,2025-07-25 11:52:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19185v1
How to Copy-Protect Malleable-Puncturable Cryptographic Functionalities Under Arbitrary Challenge Distributions,"A quantum copy-protection scheme (Aaronson, CCC 2009) encodes a functionality into a quantum state such that given this state, no efficient adversary can create two (possibly entangled) quantum states that are both capable of running the functionality. There has been a recent line of works on constructing provably-secure copy-protection schemes for general classes of schemes in the plain model, and most recently the recent work of Çakan and Goyal (IACR Eprint, 2025) showed how to copy-protect all cryptographically puncturable schemes with pseudorandom puncturing points. In this work, we show how to copy-protect even a larger class of schemes. We define a class of cryptographic schemes called malleable-puncturable schemes where the only requirement is that one can create a circuit that is capable of answering inputs at points that are unrelated to the challenge in the security game but does not help the adversary answer inputs related to the challenge. This is a flexible generalization of puncturable schemes, and can capture a wide range of primitives that was not known how to copy-protect prior to our work. Going further, we show that our scheme is secure against arbitrary high min-entropy challenge distributions whereas previous work has only considered schemes that are punctured at pseudorandom points.",2025-07-25 07:40:44+00:00,2025-07-25 07:40:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19032v1
From Cloud-Native to Trust-Native: A Protocol for Verifiable Multi-Agent Systems,"As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight, TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.",2025-07-25 04:38:38+00:00,2025-07-25 04:38:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22077v1
Bridging Cloud Convenience and Protocol Transparency: A Hybrid Architecture for Ethereum Node Operations on Amazon Managed Blockchain,"As blockchain technologies are increasingly adopted in enterprise and research domains, the need for secure, scalable, and performance-transparent node infrastructure has become critical. While self-hosted Ethereum nodes offer operational control, they often lack elasticity and require complex maintenance. This paper presents a hybrid, service-oriented architecture for deploying and monitoring Ethereum full nodes using Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), integrated with EC2-based observability, IAM-enforced security policies, and reproducible automation via the AWS Cloud Development Kit. Our architecture supports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py and JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points-including gas utilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics are visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level performance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework restores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining the operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of AMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise monitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible, performance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB. The proposed hybrid architecture enables secure, observable, and reproducible Ethereum node operations in cloud environments, suitable for both research and production use.",2025-07-24 19:55:35+00:00,2025-07-24 19:55:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18774v1
Thermal-Aware 3D Design for Side-Channel Information Leakage,"Side-channel attacks are important security challenges as they reveal sensitive information about on-chip activities. Among such attacks, the thermal side-channel has been shown to disclose the activities of key functional blocks and even encryption keys. This paper proposes a novel approach to proactively conceal critical activities in the functional layers while minimizing the power dissipation by (i) leveraging inherent characteristics of 3D integration to protect from side-channel attacks and (ii) dynamically generating custom activity patterns to match the activity to be concealed in the functional layers. Experimental analysis shows that 3D technology combined with the proposed run-time algorithm effectively reduces the Side channel vulnerability Factor (SVF) below 0.05 and the Spatial Thermal Side-channel Factor (STSF) below 0.59.",2025-07-24 15:39:46+00:00,2025-07-24 15:39:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02816v1
LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models,"Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a ""pre-training and fine-tuning"" paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the ""pre-training and fine-tuning"" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.",2025-07-24 11:18:27+00:00,2025-07-24 11:18:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302v1
Auto-SGCR: Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range Using IEC 61850 Standard Models,"Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.",2025-07-24 09:44:03+00:00,2025-07-24 09:44:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18249v1
Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications,"The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.   To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases.   Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems.",2025-07-24 05:30:54+00:00,2025-07-24 05:30:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105v1
PyPitfall: Dependency Chaos and Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Python,"Python software development heavily relies on third-party packages. Direct and transitive dependencies create a labyrinth of software supply chains. While it is convenient to reuse code, vulnerabilities within these dependency chains can propagate through dependencies, potentially affecting down-stream packages and applications. PyPI, the official Python package repository, hosts many packages and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of vulnerable dependencies. This paper introduces PyPitfall, a quantitative analysis of vulnerable dependencies across the PyPI ecosystem. We analyzed the dependency structures of 378,573 PyPI packages and identified 4,655 packages that explicitly require at least one known-vulnerable version and 141,044 packages that permit vulnerable versions within specified ranges. By characterizing the ecosystem-wide dependency landscape and the security impact of transitive dependencies, we aim to raise awareness of Python software supply chain security.",2025-07-24 03:58:18+00:00,2025-07-24 03:58:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18075v1
C-AAE: Compressively Anonymizing Autoencoders for Privacy-Preserving Activity Recognition in Healthcare Sensor Streams,"Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %, easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous, sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.",2025-07-24 03:55:04+00:00,2025-07-24 03:55:04+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18072v1
Removing Box-Free Watermarks for Image-to-Image Models via Query-Based Reverse Engineering,"The intellectual property of deep generative networks (GNets) can be protected using a cascaded hiding network (HNet) which embeds watermarks (or marks) into GNet outputs, known as box-free watermarking. Although both GNet and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet), with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet, with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model watermarking.",2025-07-24 02:05:55+00:00,2025-07-24 02:05:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18034v1
MeAJOR Corpus: A Multi-Source Dataset for Phishing Email Detection,"Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness, achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and reproducibility.",2025-11-06 16:20:31+00:00,2025-07-23 22:57:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17978v2
Formal Verification of the Safegcd Implementation,"The modular inverse is an essential piece of computation required for elliptic curve operations used for digital signatures in Bitcoin and other applications. A novel approach to the extended Euclidean algorithm has been developed by Bernstein and Yang within the last few years and incorporated into the libsecp256k1 cryptographic library used by Bitcoin. However, novel algorithms introduce new risks of errors. To address this we have completed a computer verified proof of the correctness of (one of) libsecp256k1's modular inverse implementations with the Coq proof assistant using the Verifiable C's implementation of separation logic.",2025-07-23 21:57:30+00:00,2025-07-23 21:57:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17956v1
"""Think First, Verify Always"": Training Humans to Face AI Risks","Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented attacks on human cognition, yet cybersecurity remains predominantly device-centric. This paper introduces the ""Think First, Verify Always"" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as 'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity, Judgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized controlled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention produced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task performance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to controls. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can rapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We recommend that GenAI platforms embed ""Think First, Verify Always"" as a standard prompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance trustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical cybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered security as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.",2025-07-23 19:59:08+00:00,2025-07-23 19:59:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03714v1
Lower Bounds for Public-Private Learning under Distribution Shift,"The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small (relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the shift is large, public data provides no benefit.",2025-07-23 19:46:08+00:00,2025-07-23 19:46:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17895v1
Learning to Locate: GNN-Powered Vulnerability Path Discovery in Open Source Code,"Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points (PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.",2025-07-23 19:30:37+00:00,2025-07-23 19:30:37+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17888v1
Performance Evaluation and Threat Mitigation in Large-scale 5G Core Deployment,"The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.",2025-07-23 18:17:26+00:00,2025-07-23 18:17:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17850v1
CASCADE: LLM-Powered JavaScript Deobfuscator at Google,"Software obfuscation, particularly prevalent in JavaScript, hinders code comprehension and analysis, posing significant challenges to software testing, static analysis, and malware detection. This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.",2025-07-23 16:57:32+00:00,2025-07-23 16:57:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17691v1
Quantifying the ROI of Cyber Threat Intelligence: A Data-Driven Approach,"The valuation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) remains a persistent challenge due to the problem of negative evidence: successful threat prevention results in non-events that generate minimal observable financial impact, making CTI expenditures difficult to justify within traditional cost-benefit frameworks. This study introduces a data-driven methodology for quantifying the return on investment (ROI) of CTI, thereby reframing it as a measurable contributor to risk mitigation. The proposed framework extends established models in security economics, including the Gordon-Loeb and FAIR models, to account for CTI's complex influence on both the probability of security breaches and the severity of associated losses. The framework is operationalized through empirically grounded performance indicators, such as reductions in mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), and adversary dwell time, supported by three sector-specific case studies in finance, healthcare, and retail. To address limitations in conventional linear assessment methodologies, the Threat Intelligence Effectiveness Index (TIEI) is introduced as a composite metric based on a weighted geometric mean. TIEI penalizes underperformance across critical dimensions: quality, enrichment, integration, and operational impact; thereby capturing bottleneck effect where the least effective component limits overall performance. By integrating financial quantification, adversarial coverage, and qualitative assessments of business enablement, the proposed hybrid model converts negative evidence into a justifiable ROI explanation. This approach offers a replicable means of repositioning CTI from an expense to a strategic investment, enabling informed decision-making and continuous optimization across diverse organizational contexts.",2025-07-23 15:54:56+00:00,2025-07-23 15:54:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17628v1
Enabling Cyber Security Education through Digital Twins and Generative AI,"Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.",2025-07-23 13:55:35+00:00,2025-07-23 13:55:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17518v1
Frequency Estimation of Correlated Multi-attribute Data under Local Differential Privacy,"Large-scale data collection, from national censuses to IoT-enabled smart homes, routinely gathers dozens of attributes per individual. These multi-attribute datasets are vital for analytics but pose significant privacy risks. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is a powerful tool to protect user data privacy by allowing users to locally perturb their records before releasing to an untrusted data aggregator. However, existing LDP mechanisms either split the privacy budget across all attributes or treat each attribute independently, ignoring natural inter-attribute correlations. This leads to excessive noise or fragmented budgets, resulting in significant utility loss, particularly in high-dimensional settings.   To overcome these limitations, we propose Correlated Randomized Response (Corr-RR), a novel LDP mechanism that leverages correlations among attributes to substantially improve utility while maintaining rigorous LDP guarantees. Corr-RR allocates the full privacy budget to perturb a single, randomly selected attribute and reconstructs the remaining attributes using estimated interattribute dependencies, without incurring additional privacy cost. To enable this, Corr-RR operates in two phases: (1) a subset of users apply standard LDP mechanisms to estimate correlations, and (2) each remaining user perturbs one attribute and infers the others using the learned correlations. We theoretically prove that Corr-RR satisfies $ε$-LDP, and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Corr-RR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms, particularly in scenarios with many attributes and strong inter-attribute correlations.",2025-07-23 13:52:45+00:00,2025-07-23 13:52:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17516v1
Active Attack Resilience in 5G: A New Take on Authentication and Key Agreement,"As 5G networks expand into critical infrastructure, secure and efficient user authentication is more important than ever. The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized by 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments. It provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However, despite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and performance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers, recent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a sequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect synchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design adds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication overhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing past communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern amid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication protocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings. First, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance, reducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and infrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal cryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif, confirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including resistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and academic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their performance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21). Our results show the proposed protocols offer stronger security with only minor computational overhead, making them practical, future-ready solutions for 5G and beyond.",2025-07-28 04:24:08+00:00,2025-07-23 13:18:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17491v2
Leveraging Trustworthy AI for Automotive Security in Multi-Domain Operations: Towards a Responsive Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Force for Cyber Social Security,"Multi-Domain Operations (MDOs) emphasize cross-domain defense against complex and synergistic threats, with civilian infrastructures like smart cities and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) emerging as primary targets. As dual-use assets, CAVs are vulnerable to Multi-Surface Threats (MSTs), particularly from Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) which can simultaneously compromise multiple in-vehicle ML systems (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems, Traffic Sign Recognition Systems). Therefore, this study investigates how key hyperparameters in Decision Tree-based ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-affect the time required for a Black-Box AML attack i.e. Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO). Findings show that parameters like the number of trees or boosting rounds significantly influence attack execution time, with RF and GB being more sensitive than XGB. Adversarial Training (AT) time is also analyzed to assess the attacker's window of opportunity. By optimizing hyperparameters, this research supports Defensive Trustworthy AI (D-TAI) practices within MST scenarios and contributes to the development of resilient ML systems for civilian and military domains, aligned with Cyber Social Security framework in MDOs and Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Forces.",2025-07-23 11:46:52+00:00,2025-07-23 11:46:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21145v1
Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.",2025-07-23 06:56:34+00:00,2025-07-23 06:56:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1
GATEBLEED: Exploiting On-Core Accelerator Power Gating for High Performance & Stealthy Attacks on AI,"As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.",2025-10-02 18:20:18+00:00,2025-07-22 21:41:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17033v3

This paper explores how cybercriminals exploit YouTube to disseminate malware, focusing on campaigns that promote free software or game cheats. It discusses deceptive video demonstrations and the techniques behind malware delivery. Additionally, the paper presents a new evasion technique that abuses YouTube's multilingual metadata capabilities to circumvent automated detection systems.

Evaluating Ensemble and Deep Learning Models for Static Malware Detection with Dimensionality Reduction Using the EMBER Dataset,"This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type. This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.",2025-07-24 22:23:53+00:00,2025-07-22 18:45:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16952v2
Analysis of Threat-Based Manipulation in Large Language Models: A Dual Perspective on Vulnerabilities and Performance Enhancement Opportunities,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate complex responses to threat-based manipulations, revealing both vulnerabilities and unexpected performance enhancement opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of 3,390 experimental responses from three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions. We introduce a novel threat taxonomy and multi-metric evaluation framework to quantify both negative manipulation effects and positive performance improvements. Results reveal systematic vulnerabilities, with policy evaluation showing the highest metric significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%.

LLMxCPG: Context-Aware Vulnerability Detection Through Code Property Graph-Guided Large Language Models,"Software vulnerabilities present a persistent security challenge, with over 25,000 new vulnerabilities reported in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in 2024 alone. While deep learning based approaches show promise for vulnerability detection, recent studies reveal critical limitations in terms of accuracy and robustness: accuracy drops by up to 45% on rigorously verified datasets, and performance degrades significantly under simple code modifications. This paper presents LLMxCPG, a novel framework integrating Code Property Graphs (CPG) with Large Language Models (LLM) for robust vulnerability detection. Our CPG-based slice construction technique reduces code size by 67.84 to 90.93% while preserving vulnerability-relevant context. Our approach's ability to provide a more concise and accurate representation of code snippets enables the analysis of larger code segments, including entire projects. This concise representation is a key factor behind the improved detection capabilities of our method, as it can now identify vulnerabilities that span multiple functions. Empirical evaluation demonstrates LLMxCPG's effectiveness across verified datasets, achieving 15-40% improvements in F1-score over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, LLMxCPG maintains high performance across function-level and multi-function codebases while exhibiting robust detection efficacy under various syntactic code modifications.",2025-07-22 13:36:33+00:00,2025-07-22 13:36:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16585v1
From Text to Actionable Intelligence: Automating STIX Entity and Relationship Extraction,"Sharing methods of attack and their effectiveness is a cornerstone of building robust defensive systems. Threat analysis reports, produced by various individuals and organizations, play a critical role in supporting security operations and combating emerging threats. To enhance the timeliness and automation of threat intelligence sharing, several standards have been established, with the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) framework emerging as one of the most widely adopted. However, generating STIX-compatible data from unstructured security text remains a largely manual, expert-driven process. To address this challenge, we introduce AZERG, a tool designed to assist security analysts in automatically generating structured STIX representations. To achieve this, we adapt general-purpose large language models for the specific task of extracting STIX-formatted threat data. To manage the complexity, the task is divided into four subtasks: entity detection (T1), entity type identification (T2), related pair detection (T3), and relationship type identification (T4). We apply task-specific fine-tuning to accurately extract relevant entities and infer their relationships in accordance with the STIX specification. To address the lack of training data, we compiled a comprehensive dataset with 4,011 entities and 2,075 relationships extracted from 141 full threat analysis reports, all annotated in alignment with the STIX standard. Our models achieved F1-scores of 84.43% for T1, 88.49% for T2, 95.47% for T3, and 84.60% for T4 in real-world scenarios. We validated their performance against a range of open- and closed-parameter models, as well as state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improvements of 2-25% across tasks.",2025-07-22 13:27:09+00:00,2025-07-22 13:27:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16576v1
Explainable Vulnerability Detection in C/C++ Using Edge-Aware Graph Attention Networks,"Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging, particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability, limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage.",2025-07-22 12:49:14+00:00,2025-07-22 12:49:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16540v1
Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.",2025-07-22 09:15:11+00:00,2025-07-22 09:15:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1
From Contracts to Code: Automating Smart Contract Generation with Multi-Level Finite State Machines,"In an increasingly complex contractual landscape, the demand for transparency, security, and efficiency has intensified. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable nature, addresses these challenges by reducing intermediary costs, minimizing fraud risks, and enhancing system compatibility. Smart contracts, initially conceptualized by Nick Szabo and later implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, automate and secure contractual clauses, offering a robust solution for various industries. However, their complexity and the requirement for advanced programming skills present significant barriers to widespread adoption. This study introduces a multi-level finite state machine model designed to represent and track the execution of smart contracts. Our model aims to simplify smart contract development by providing a formalized framework that abstracts underlying technical complexities, making it accessible to professionals without deep technical expertise. The hierarchical structure of the multi-level finite state machine enhances contract modularity and traceability, facilitating detailed representation and evaluation of functional properties. The paper explores the potential of this multi-level approach, reviewing existing methodologies and tools, and detailing the smart contract generation process with an emphasis on reusable components and modularity. We also conduct a security analysis to evaluate potential vulnerabilities in our model, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the generated smart contracts.",2025-07-22 06:41:30+00:00,2025-07-22 06:41:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16276v1
Building a robust OAuth token based API Security: A High level Overview,"APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or Web Services are the foundational building blocks that enable interconnected systems. However this proliferation of APIs has also introduced security challenges that require systematic and scalable solutions for secure authentication and authorization. This paper presents the fundamentals necessary for building a such a token-based API security system. It discusses the components necessary, the integration of OAuth 2.0, extensibility of the token architectures, necessary cryptographic foundations, and persistence strategies to ensure secure and resilient operations. In addition to architectural concerns, the paper explores best practices for token lifecycle management, scope definition, expiration policies, and revocation mechanisms, all framed within a real-world scenario. By adhering to these principles, developers can establish a robust baseline while maintaining the flexibility to customize their domain-specific requirements. The approach does not claim to cover all variations necessary for diverse architectures but instead focuses on key principles essential for any standard API token authentication system. Throughout, the paper emphasizes balancing practical considerations with security imperatives and uses key concepts such as the CIA triad, OAuth standards, secure token life cycle, and practices for protecting sensitive user and application data. The intent is to equip developers with the foundational knowledge necessary to build secure, scalable token-based API security systems ready to handle the evolving threat landscape.",2025-07-22 06:14:14+00:00,2025-07-22 06:14:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16870v1
eX-NIDS: A Framework for Explainable Network Intrusion Detection Leveraging Large Language Models,"This paper introduces eX-NIDS, a framework designed to enhance interpretability in flow-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). In our proposed framework, flows labelled as malicious by NIDS are initially processed through a module called the Prompt Augmenter. This module extracts contextual information and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)-related knowledge from these flows. This enriched, context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM, enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models, employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations, focusing on their correctness and consistency. The results demonstrate that augmented LLMs can produce accurate and consistent explanations, serving as valuable complementary tools in NIDS to explain the classification of malicious flows. The use of augmented prompts enhances performance by over 20% compared to the Basic-Prompt Explainer.",2025-07-22 05:26:21+00:00,2025-07-22 05:26:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16241v1
SVAgent: AI Agent for Hardware Security Verification Assertion,"Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular methods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations. It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex integrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a requirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex requirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving chain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the influence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation indicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly better than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated SVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment framework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering design environment.",2025-07-22 03:36:06+00:00,2025-07-22 03:36:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16203v1
Pulse-Level Simulation of Crosstalk Attacks on Superconducting Quantum Hardware,"Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame, capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust. Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.",2025-07-25 14:49:58+00:00,2025-07-22 02:52:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16181v2
Implementasi dan Pengujian Polimorfisme pada Malware Menggunakan Dasar Payload Metasploit Framework,"Malware change day by day and become sophisticated. Not only the complexity of the algorithm that generating malware, but also the camouflage methods. Camouflage, formerly, only need a simple encryption. Now, camouflage are able to change the pattern of code automatically. This term called Polymorphism. This property is usually used to create a metamorphic and a polymorphic malware. Although it has been around since 1990 still quite tricky to detect. In general, there are three obfuscation techniques to create the nature of polymorphism. That techniques are dead code insertion, register substitution, and instruction replacement. This technique can be added to the Metasploit Framework via Ghost Writing Assembly to get ASM files. The detection methods that be used are VT-notify, Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH), and direct scanning with an antivirus that has been selected. VTnotify show nothing wrong with the files. The best CTPH value is generated by a mixture of technique (average: 52.3125%), while if it is compared to the number of changes made, instruction replacement have the best comparative value (0.0256). The result of using antivirus scanning produces a variety of different results. Antivirus with behavioural-based detection has a possibility to detect this polymorphism.",2025-07-21 22:29:27+00:00,2025-07-21 22:29:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00874v1
MFAz: Historical Access Based Multi-Factor Authorization,"Unauthorized access remains one of the critical security challenges in the realm of cybersecurity. With the increasing sophistication of attack techniques, the threat of unauthorized access is no longer confined to the conventional ones, such as exploiting weak access control policies. Instead, advanced exploitation strategies, such as session hijacking-based attacks, are becoming increasingly prevalent, posing serious security concerns. Session hijacking enables attackers to take over an already established session between legitimate peers in a stealthy manner, thereby gaining unauthorized access to private resources. Unfortunately, traditional access control mechanisms, such as static access control policies, are insufficient to prevent session hijacking or other advanced exploitation techniques. In this work, we propose a new multi-factor authorization (MFAz) scheme that proactively mitigates unauthorized access attempts both conventional and advanced unauthorized access attacks. The proposed scheme employs fine-grained access control rules (ARs) and verification points (VPs) that are systematically generated from historically granted accesses as the first and second authorization factors, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the scheme using different techniques. We leverage bloom filter to achieve runtime and storage efficiency, and blockchain to make authorization decisions in a temper-proof and decentralized manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal introduction of a multi-factor authorization scheme, which is orthogonal to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) schemes. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is experimentally evaluated using a smart-city testbed involving different devices with varying computational capacities. The experimental results reveal high effectiveness of the scheme both in security and performance guarantees.",2025-07-21 20:54:04+00:00,2025-07-21 20:54:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16060v1
Chameleon Channels: Measuring YouTube Accounts Repurposed for Deception and Profit,"Online content creators spend significant time and effort building their user base through a long, often arduous process, which requires finding the right ``niche'' to cater to. So, what incentive is there for an established content creator known for cat memes to completely reinvent their page channel and start promoting cryptocurrency services or cover electoral news events? And, if they do, do their existing subscribers not notice? We explore this problem of \textit{repurposed channels}, whereby a channel changes its identity and contents. We first characterize a market for ``second-hand'' social media accounts, which recorded sales exceeding USD~1M during our 6-month observation period. By observing YouTube channels (re)sold over these 6~months, we find that a substantial number (37\%) are used to disseminate potentially harmful content, often without facing any penalty. Even more surprisingly, these channels seem to gain rather than lose subscribers. To estimate the prevalence of channel repurposing ``in the wild,'' we also collect two snapshots of 1.4M quasi-randomly sampled YouTube accounts. In a 3-month period, we estimate that $\sim$0.25\% channels -- collectively holding $\sim$44M subscribers -- were repurposed. We confirm that these repurposed channels share several characteristics with sold channels -- mainly, the fact that they had a significantly high presence of potentially problematic content. Across repurposed channels, we find channels that became disinformation channels, as well as channels that link to web pages with financial scams. We reason that abusing the residual trust placed on these channels is advantageous to financially- and ideologically-motivated adversaries.

"""We Need a Standard"": Toward an Expert-Informed Privacy Label for Differential Privacy","The increasing adoption of differential privacy (DP) leads to public-facing DP deployments by both government agencies and companies. However, real-world DP deployments often do not fully disclose their privacy guarantees, which vary greatly between deployments. Failure to disclose certain DP parameters can lead to misunderstandings about the strength of the privacy guarantee, undermining the trust in DP. In this work, we seek to inform future standards for communicating the privacy guarantees of DP deployments. Based on semi-structured interviews with 12 DP experts, we identify important DP parameters necessary to comprehensively communicate DP guarantees, and describe why and how they should be disclosed. Based on expert recommendations, we design an initial privacy label for DP to comprehensively communicate privacy guarantees in a standardized format.",2025-07-21 18:32:04+00:00,2025-07-21 18:32:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15997v1
BACFuzz: Exposing the Silence on Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities in Web Applications,"Broken Access Control (BAC) remains one of the most critical and widespread vulnerabilities in web applications, allowing attackers to access unauthorized resources or perform privileged actions. Despite its severity, BAC is underexplored in automated testing due to key challenges: the lack of reliable oracles and the difficulty of generating semantically valid attack requests. We introduce BACFuzz, the first gray-box fuzzing framework specifically designed to uncover BAC vulnerabilities, including Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA) and Broken Function-Level Authorization (BFLA) in PHP-based web applications. BACFuzz combines LLM-guided parameter selection with runtime feedback and SQL-based oracle checking to detect silent authorization flaws. It employs lightweight instrumentation to capture runtime information that guides test generation, and analyzes backend SQL queries to verify whether unauthorized inputs flow into protected operations. Evaluated on 20 real-world web applications, including 15 CVE cases and 2 known benchmarks, BACFuzz detects 16 of 17 known issues and uncovers 26 previously unknown BAC vulnerabilities with low false positive rates. All identified issues have been responsibly disclosed, and artifacts will be publicly released.",2025-07-21 18:25:11+00:00,2025-07-21 18:25:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15984v1
Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems,"Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place.   We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called ""spotlighting"" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.",2025-07-21 13:38:12+00:00,2025-07-21 13:38:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1
SynthCTI: LLM-Driven Synthetic CTI Generation to enhance MITRE Technique Mapping,"Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining involves extracting structured insights from unstructured threat data, enabling organizations to understand and respond to evolving adversarial behavior. A key task in CTI mining is mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. However, this process is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort. Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI, a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. Our method uses a clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity. Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\%), and SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412). Notably, smaller models augmented with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation, demonstrating the value of data generation methods for building efficient and effective CTI classification systems.",2025-07-21 09:22:39+00:00,2025-07-21 09:22:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16852v1
PiMRef: Detecting and Explaining Ever-evolving Spear Phishing Emails with Knowledge Base Invariants,"Phishing emails are a critical component of the cybercrime kill chain due to their wide reach and low cost. Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional rule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs) further exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing phishing emails at minimal cost.   This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive phishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all commercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose PiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages knowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails often contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts. PiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an email, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the legitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and (iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory claims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable explanations.   Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector, PiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks like Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across five university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision, 87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art in both effectiveness and efficiency.",2025-07-21 08:53:41+00:00,2025-07-21 08:53:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15393v1

As ChatGPT has become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios.

Metaverse Security and Privacy Research: A Systematic Review,"The rapid growth of metaverse technologies, including virtual worlds, augmented reality, and lifelogging, has accelerated their adoption across diverse domains. This rise exposes users to significant new security and privacy challenges due to sociotechnical complexity, pervasive connectivity, and extensive user data collection in immersive environments. We present a systematic review of the literature published between 2013 and 2024, offering a comprehensive analysis of how the research community has addressed metaverse-related security and privacy issues over the past decade. We organize the studies by method, examined the security and privacy properties, immersive components, and evaluation strategies. Our investigation reveals a sharp increase in research activity in the last five years, a strong focus on practical and user-centered approaches, and a predominant use of benchmarking, human experimentation, and qualitative methods. Authentication and unobservability are the most frequently studied properties. However, critical gaps remain in areas such as policy compliance, accessibility, interoperability, and back-end infrastructure security. We emphasize the intertwined technical complexity and human factors of the metaverse and call for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to securing inclusive and trustworthy immersive environments.",2025-07-20 14:42:17+00:00,2025-07-20 14:42:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14985v1
A Compact Post-quantum Strong Designated Verifier Signature Scheme from Isogenies,"Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we present $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative to existing SDVS constructions. The scheme leverages the ideal class group action on $\mathbb{F}_p$-isomorphism classes of supersingular elliptic curves and is founded on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.",2025-08-18 08:48:17+00:00,2025-07-20 10:15:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14893v3
A Privacy-Centric Approach: Scalable and Secure Federated Learning Enabled by Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for privacy-sensitive domains. Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of communication overhead and data privacy. Privacy-preserving Techniques (PPTs) such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) have been used to mitigate these concerns. However, these techniques introduce substantial computational and communication costs, limiting their practical deployment. In this work, we explore how Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE), a cryptographic protocol that combines symmetric encryption with HE, can be effectively integrated with FL to address both communication and privacy challenges, paving the way for scalable and secure decentralized learning system.",2025-08-07 06:51:48+00:00,2025-07-20 07:46:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14853v2
Time Entangled Quantum Blockchain with Phase Encoding for Classical Data,"With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.",2025-11-20 07:16:17+00:00,2025-07-20 06:50:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14839v2
Manipulating LLM Web Agents with Indirect Prompt Injection Attack via HTML Accessibility Tree,"This work demonstrates that LLM-based web navigation agents offer powerful automation capabilities but are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks.

Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by Llama-3.1, our system demonstrates high success rates across real websites in both targeted and general attacks, including login credential exfiltration and forced ad clicks.

A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Rainbow Table Attack on Human Passwords,"Long, human-generated passwords pose significant challenges to both classical and quantum attacks due to their irregular structure and large search space. In this work, we propose an enhanced classical-quantum hybrid attack specifically designed for this scenario. Our approach constructs rainbow tables using dictionary-based password generation augmented with transformation rules that better capture real-world user behavior. These tables are organized into buckets, enabling faster lookup and reduced space complexity. For the search within each bucket, we employ a distributed exact variant of Grover's algorithm. This method provides deterministic success and significantly lower circuit depth, enhancing robustness against noise-particularly depolarizing errors common in near-term quantum devices. Overall, our hybrid framework improves the efficiency and practicality of password recovery for long, human-readable passwords in realistic adversarial settings.",2025-07-28 05:34:07+00:00,2025-07-19 12:51:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14600v2
Quantum-Safe Identity Verification using Relativistic Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems,"Identity verification is the process of confirming an individual's claimed identity, which is essential in sectors like finance, healthcare, and online services to ensure security and prevent fraud. However, current password/PIN-based identity solutions are susceptible to phishing or skimming attacks, where malicious intermediaries attempt to steal credentials using fake identification portals. Alikhani et al. [Nature, 2021] began exploring identity verification through graph coloring-based relativistic zero-knowledge proofs (RZKPs), a key cryptographic primitive that enables a prover to demonstrate knowledge of secret credentials to a verifier without disclosing any information about the secret. Our work advances this field and addresses unresolved issues: From an engineering perspective, we relax further the relativistic constraints from 60m to 30m, and significantly enhance the stability and scalability of the experimental demonstration of the 2-prover graph coloring-based RZKP protocol for near-term use cases. At the same time, for long-term security against entangled malicious provers, we propose a modified protocol with comparable computation and communication costs, we establish an upper bound on the soundness parameter for this modified protocol. On the other hand, we extend the two-prover, two-verifier setup to a three-prover configuration, demonstrating the security of such relativistic protocols against entangled malicious provers.",2025-07-18 18:59:19+00:00,2025-07-18 18:59:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14324v1
FedStrategist: A Meta-Learning Framework for Adaptive and Robust Aggregation in Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable"" environment and against a sophisticated ""stealth"" adversary designed to neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy, and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a single ""risk tolerance"" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new, practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems.",2025-07-28 23:58:45+00:00,2025-07-18 18:53:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14322v2
An Adversarial-Driven Experimental Study on Deep Learning for RF Fingerprinting,"Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.",2025-10-28 21:11:23+00:00,2025-07-18 17:42:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14109v2
The CryptoNeo Threat Modelling Framework (CNTMF): Securing Neobanks and Fintech in Integrated Blockchain Ecosystems,"The rapid integration of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3 technologies into digital banks and fintech operations has created an integrated environment blending traditional financial systems with decentralised elements.

CNTMF represents a proposed extension of established methodologies like STRIDE, OWASP Top 10, NIST frameworks, LINDDUN, and PASTA, while incorporating tailored components including Hybrid Layer Analysis, the CRYPTOQ mnemonic for cryptocurrency-specific risks, and an AI-Augmented Feedback Loop. Drawing on real-world data from 2025 incidents, CNTMF supports data-driven mitigation to reduce losses, which totalled approximately $2.47 billion in the first half of 2025 across 344 security events (CertiK via GlobeNewswire, 2025; Infosecurity Magazine, 2025).

Chain Table: Protecting Table-Level Data Integrity by Digital Ledger Technology,"The rise of blockchain and Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) has gained wide traction. Instead of relying on a traditional centralized data authority, a blockchain system consists of digitally entangled block data shared across a distributed network. The specially designed chain data structure and its consensus mechanism protect blockchain data from being tampered by unauthorized adversaries. However, implementing a full-fledged blockchain system to protect a database can be technically cumbersome. In this work, we introduce an in-database design, named chain table, to protect data integrity without the need for a blockchain system. It features a succinct design without significant technology barriers or storage overhead. To realize rigorous data security, we also propose a set of data writing principles for the chain table. We prove that the chain table, together with the data writing principles, will guarantee flexible data integrity, named table-level data integrity (TDI).",2025-07-18 14:08:24+00:00,2025-07-18 14:08:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13932v1
Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index and Verified AgentFacts,"The Internet is poised to host billions to trillions of autonomous AI agents that negotiate, delegate, and migrate in milliseconds and workloads that will strain DNS-centred identity and discovery. In this paper, we describe the NANDA index architecture, which we envision as a means for discoverability, identifiability and authentication in the internet of AI agents. We present an architecture where a minimal lean index resolves to dynamic, cryptographically verifiable AgentFacts that supports multi-endpoint routing, load balancing, privacy-preserving access, and credentialed capability assertions. Our architecture design delivers five concrete guarantees: (1) A quilt-like index proposal that supports both NANDA-native agents as well as third party agents being discoverable via the index, (2) rapid global resolution for newly spawned AI agents, (3) sub-second revocation and key rotation, (4) schema-validated capability assertions, and (5) privacy-preserving discovery across organisational boundaries via verifiable, least-disclosure queries. We formalize the AgentFacts schema, specify a CRDT-based update protocol, and prototype adaptive resolvers. The result is a lightweight, horizontally scalable foundation that unlocks secure, trust-aware collaboration for the next generation of the Internet of AI agents, without abandoning existing web infrastructure.",2025-07-18 13:40:46+00:00,2025-07-18 13:40:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14263v1
"Stablecoins: Fundamentals, Emerging Issues, and Open Challenges","Stablecoins, with a capitalization exceeding 200 billion USD as of January 2025, have shown significant growth, with annual transaction volumes exceeding 10 trillion dollars in 2023 and nearly doubling that figure in 2024. This exceptional success has attracted the attention of traditional financial institutions, with an increasing number of governments exploring the potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Although academia has recognized the importance of stablecoins, research in this area remains fragmented, incomplete, and sometimes contradictory. In this paper, we aim to address the cited gap with a structured literature analysis, correlating recent contributions to present a picture of the complex economic, technical, and regulatory aspects of stablecoins. To achieve this, we formulate the main research questions and categorize scientific contributions accordingly, identifying main results, data sources, methodologies, and open research questions. The research questions we address in this survey paper cover several topics, such as the stability of various stablecoins, novel designs and implementations, and relevant regulatory challenges. The studies employ a wide range of methodologies and data sources, which we critically analyze and synthesize.

Quantum Shadows: The Dining Information Brokers,"This article introduces the innovative Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem, presenting a novel entanglement-based quantum protocol to address it. The scenario involves $n$ information brokers, all located in distinct geographical regions, engaging in a metaphorical virtual dinner. The objective is for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully parallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of their physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to ensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved, meaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received information. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves as a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively parallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol introduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for one-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate many-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete anonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over sequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such robust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates in a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial locations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable, and anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed environments where privacy and parallelism are paramount.",2025-07-18 10:41:27+00:00,2025-07-18 10:41:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13810v1

Fast computational deep thermalization,"Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement. Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms, these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.",2025-07-18 05:42:05+00:00,2025-07-18 05:42:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13670v1
Differential Privacy in Kernelized Contextual Bandits via Random Projections,"We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We study this problem under an additional constraint of Differential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the state-of-the-art cumulative regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{γ_TT}+\frac{γ_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{γ_TT}+\frac{γ_T\sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ over a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential privacy, respectively, where $γ_T$ is the effective dimension of the kernel and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression estimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and private random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity compared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction accuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance guarantees.",2025-07-18 03:54:49+00:00,2025-07-18 03:54:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13639v1
FuSeFL: Fully Secure and Scalable Cross-Silo Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains. While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving large datasets and strict compliance requirements.   We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to 95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and efficiency at scale.",2025-08-23 00:34:03+00:00,2025-07-18 00:50:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13591v2
PHASE: Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation,"Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic, thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.",2025-07-17 19:24:11+00:00,2025-07-17 19:24:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13505v1
A Crowdsensing Intrusion Detection Dataset For Decentralized Federated Learning Models,"This paper introduces a dataset and experimental study for decentralized federated learning (DFL) applied to IoT crowdsensing malware detection. The dataset comprises behavioral records from benign and eight malware families. A total of 21,582,484 original records were collected from system calls, file system activities, resource usage, kernel events, input/output events, and network records. These records were aggregated into 30-second windows, resulting in 342,106 features used for model training and evaluation. Experiments on the DFL platform compare traditional machine learning (ML), centralized federated learning (CFL), and DFL across different node counts, topologies, and data distributions. Results show that DFL maintains competitive performance while preserving data locality, outperforming CFL in most settings. This dataset provides a solid foundation for studying the security of IoT crowdsensing environments.",2025-07-17 17:33:11+00:00,2025-07-17 17:33:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13313v1
SHIELD: A Secure and Highly Enhanced Integrated Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection against Adversarial Attacks,"Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification, voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models. The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%, and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and HalfTruth datasets, respectively.",2025-07-17 14:33:54+00:00,2025-07-17 14:33:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13170v1
Prompt Injection 2.0: Hybrid AI Threats,"Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures. We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies, evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.",2025-07-17 14:33:36+00:00,2025-07-17 14:33:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13169v1
From Paranoia to Compliance: The Bumpy Road of System Hardening Practices on Stack Exchange,"Hardening computer systems against cyberattacks is crucial for security. However, past incidents illustrated, that many system operators struggle with effective system hardening. Hence, many computer systems and applications remain insecure. So far, the research community lacks an in-depth understanding of system operators motivation, practices, and challenges around system hardening. With a focus on practices and challenges, we qualitatively analyzed 316 Stack Exchange (SE) posts related to system hardening. We find that access control and deployment-related issues are the most challenging, and system operators suffer from misconceptions and unrealistic expectations. Most frequently, posts focused on operating systems and server applications. System operators were driven by the fear of their systems getting attacked or by compliance reasons. Finally, we discuss our research questions, make recommendations for future system hardening, and illustrate the implications of our work.",2025-07-17 11:57:11+00:00,2025-07-17 11:57:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13028v1
Measuring CEX-DEX Extracted Value and Searcher Profitability: The Darkest of the MEV Dark Forest,"This paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economics and dynamics behind arbitrages between centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX-DEX) on Ethereum. We refine heuristics to identify arbitrage transactions from on-chain data and introduce a robust empirical framework to estimate arbitrage revenue without knowing traders' actual behaviors on CEX. Leveraging an extensive dataset spanning 19 months from August 2023 to March 2025, we estimate a total of 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major CEX-DEX searchers from 7,203,560 identified CEX-DEX arbitrages. Our analysis reveals increasing centralization trends as three searchers captured three-quarters of both volume and extracted value. We also demonstrate that searchers' profitability is tied to their integration level with block builders and uncover exclusive searcher-builder relationships and their market impact. Finally, we correct the previously underestimated profitability of block builders who vertically integrate with a searcher. These insights illuminate the darkest corner of the MEV landscape and highlight the critical implications of CEX-DEX arbitrages for Ethereum's decentralization.",2025-08-03 08:26:10+00:00,2025-07-17 11:50:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13023v3
"Architectural Backdoors in Deep Learning: A Survey of Vulnerabilities, Detection, and Defense","Architectural backdoors pose an under-examined but critical threat to deep neural networks, embedding malicious logic directly into a model's computational graph. Unlike traditional data poisoning or parameter manipulation, architectural backdoors evade standard mitigation techniques and persist even after clean retraining. This survey systematically consolidates research on architectural backdoors, spanning compiler-level manipulations, tainted AutoML pipelines, and supply-chain vulnerabilities. We assess emerging detection and defense strategies, including static graph inspection, dynamic fuzzing, and partial formal verification, and highlight their limitations against distributed or stealth triggers. Despite recent progress, scalable and practical defenses remain elusive. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing directions for strengthening supply-chain security, cryptographic model attestations, and next-generation benchmarks. This survey aims to guide future research toward comprehensive defenses against structural backdoor threats in deep learning systems.",2025-07-17 09:02:54+00:00,2025-07-17 09:02:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12919v1
Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework,"Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade, deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate these threats before deployment.",2025-07-17 07:45:53+00:00,2025-07-17 07:45:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872v1
IConMark: Robust Interpretable Concept-Based Watermark For AI Images,"With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness, demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique (IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9% higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on various datasets.",2025-07-17 05:38:30+00:00,2025-07-17 05:38:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13407v1
Using Modular Arithmetic Optimized Neural Networks To Crack Affine Cryptographic Schemes Efficiently,"We investigate the cryptanalysis of affine ciphers using a hybrid neural network architecture that combines modular arithmetic-aware and statistical feature-based learning. Inspired by recent advances in interpretable neural networks for modular arithmetic and neural cryptanalysis of classical ciphers, our approach integrates a modular branch that processes raw ciphertext sequences and a statistical branch that leverages letter frequency features. Experiments on datasets derived from natural English text demonstrate that the hybrid model attains high key recovery accuracy for short and moderate ciphertexts, outperforming purely statistical approaches for the affine cipher. However, performance degrades for very long ciphertexts, highlighting challenges in model generalization.",2025-07-17 04:54:10+00:00,2025-07-17 04:54:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14229v1
On the Consideration of Vanity Address Generation via Identity-Based Signatures,"An address is indicated as an identifier of the user on the blockchain, and is defined by a hash value of the ECDSA verification key. A vanity address is an address that embeds custom characters such as a name. To generate a vanity address, a classical try-and-error method is employed, and thus the number of characters to be embedded is limited. In this paper, we focus on the functionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be employed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for generating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not realistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for issuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is possible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address generation. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from signatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we cannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality of the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the functionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We implement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost same as that of the ECDSA signature verification.",2025-07-16 23:04:57+00:00,2025-07-16 23:04:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12670v1
Federated Learning in Open- and Closed-Loop EMG Decoding: A Privacy and Performance Perspective,"Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge. Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework, presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines, demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user applications.",2025-07-16 21:59:25+00:00,2025-07-16 21:59:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12652v1
A Bayesian Incentive Mechanism for Poison-Resilient Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model. Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3 percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries. This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light, budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.",2025-07-16 17:27:25+00:00,2025-07-16 17:27:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12439v1
Exploiting Jailbreaking Vulnerabilities in Generative AI to Bypass Ethical Safeguards for Facilitating Phishing Attacks,"The advent of advanced Generative AI (GenAI) models such as DeepSeek and ChatGPT has significantly reshaped the cybersecurity landscape, introducing both promising opportunities and critical risks. This study investigates how GenAI powered chatbot services can be exploited via jailbreaking techniques to bypass ethical safeguards, enabling the generation of phishing content, recommendation of hacking tools, and orchestration of phishing campaigns. In ethically controlled experiments, we used ChatGPT 4o Mini selected for its accessibility and status as the latest publicly available model at the time of experimentation, as a representative GenAI system. Our findings reveal that the model could successfully guide novice users in executing phishing attacks across various vectors, including web, email, SMS (smishing), and voice (vishing). Unlike automated phishing campaigns that typically follow detectable patterns, these human-guided, AI assisted attacks are capable of evading traditional anti phishing mechanisms, thereby posing a growing security threat. We focused on DeepSeek and ChatGPT due to their widespread adoption and technical relevance in 2025. The study further examines common jailbreaking techniques and the specific vulnerabilities exploited in these models. Finally, we evaluate a range of mitigation strategies such as user education, advanced authentication mechanisms, and regulatory policy measures and discuss emerging trends in GenAI facilitated phishing, outlining future research directions to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in the age of artificial intelligence.",2025-07-16 12:32:46+00:00,2025-07-16 12:32:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12185v1
A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Advertising Personalization Incorporating Federated Learning and Differential Privacy,"To mitigate privacy leakage and performance issues in personalized advertising, this paper proposes a framework that integrates federated learning and differential privacy. The system combines distributed feature extraction, dynamic privacy budget allocation, and robust model aggregation to balance model accuracy, communication overhead, and privacy protection. Multi-party secure computing and anomaly detection mechanisms further enhance system resilience against malicious attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves dual optimization of recommendation accuracy and system efficiency while ensuring privacy, providing both a practical solution and a theoretical foundation for applying privacy protection technologies in advertisement recommendation.",2025-07-16 10:07:19+00:00,2025-07-16 10:07:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12098v1
Expanding ML-Documentation Standards For Better Security,"This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.",2025-07-16 07:57:57+00:00,2025-07-16 07:57:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12003v1
TAB-DRW: A DFT-based Robust Watermark for Generative Tabular Data,"The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.",2025-11-26 17:16:14+00:00,2025-11-26 17:16:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21600v1
MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV,"Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.   The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.   We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.   We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.   MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.",2025-11-26 16:22:41+00:00,2025-11-26 16:22:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552v1
Constructing and Benchmarking: a Labeled Email Dataset for Text-Based Phishing and Spam Detection Framework,"Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.",2025-11-26 14:40:06+00:00,2025-11-26 14:40:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21448v1
Illuminating the Black Box: Real-Time Monitoring of Backdoor Unlearning in CNNs via Explainable AI,"Backdoor attacks pose severe security threats to deep neural networks by embedding malicious triggers that force misclassification. While machine unlearning techniques can remove backdoor behaviors, current methods lack transparency and real-time interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into the unlearning process to provide real-time monitoring and explainability. We propose the Trigger Attention Ratio (TAR) metric to quantitatively measure the model's attention shift from trigger patterns to legitimate object features. Our balanced unlearning strategy combines gradient ascent on backdoor samples, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for catastrophic forgetting prevention, and a recovery phase for clean accuracy restoration. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with BadNets attacks demonstrate that our approach reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 96.51% to 5.52% while retaining 99.48% of clean accuracy (82.06%), achieving a 94.28% ASR reduction. The integration of explainable AI enables transparent, observable, and verifiable backdoor removal.",2025-11-26 11:29:11+00:00,2025-11-26 11:29:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21291v1
Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack: Definition and Evaluation on Medical Image Data,"With the rapid expansion of data lakes storing health data and hosting AI algorithms, a prominent concern arises: how safe is it to export machine learning models from these data lakes? In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.   This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.   Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported.",2025-11-26 09:55:17+00:00,2025-11-26 09:55:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21227v1
CAHS-Attack: CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search Attack Method for Stable Diffusion,"Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.",2025-11-26 08:52:44+00:00,2025-11-26 08:52:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21180v1
GuardTrace-VL: Detecting Unsafe Multimodel Reasoning via Iterative Safety Supervision,"Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.",2025-11-26 02:49:51+00:00,2025-11-26 02:49:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20994v1
Dataset Poisoning Attacks on Behavioral Cloning Policies,"Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Readout-Side Bypass for Residual Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models,"Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.",2025-11-25 23:27:53+00:00,2025-11-25 23:27:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922v1
"Securing the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Risks, Controls, and Governance","The Model Context Protocol (MCP) replaces static, developer-controlled API integrations with more dynamic, user-driven agent systems, which also introduces new security risks. As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end. We close by outlining open research questions around verifiable registries, formal methods for these dynamic systems, and privacy-preserving agent operations.",2025-11-25 23:24:26+00:00,2025-11-25 23:24:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20920v1
"A Taxonomy of Pix Fraud in Brazil: Attack Methodologies, AI-Driven Amplification, and Defensive Strategies","This work presents a review of attack methodologies targeting Pix, the instant payment system launched by the Central Bank of Brazil in 2020. The study aims to identify and classify the main types of fraud affecting users and financial institutions, highlighting the evolution and increasing sophistication of these techniques. The methodology combines a structured literature review with exploratory interviews conducted with professionals from the banking sector. The results show that fraud schemes have evolved from purely social engineering approaches to hybrid strategies that integrate human manipulation with technical exploitation. The study concludes that security measures must advance at the same pace as the growing complexity of attack methodologies, with particular emphasis on adaptive defenses and continuous user awareness.",2025-11-25 22:41:57+00:00,2025-11-25 22:41:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20902v1
Private Data Imputation,"Data imputation is an important data preparation task where the data analyst replaces missing or erroneous values to increase the expected accuracy of downstream analyses. The accuracy improvement of data imputation extends to private data analyses across distributed databases. However, existing data imputation methods violate the privacy of the data rendering the privacy protection in the downstream analyses obsolete. We conclude that private data analysis requires private data imputation.   In this paper, we present the first optimized protocols for private data imputation. We consider the case of horizontally and vertically split data sets. Our optimization aims to reduce most of the computation to private set intersection (or at least oblivious programmable pseudo-random function) protocols which can be very efficiently computed. We show that private data imputation has -- on average across all evaluated datasets -- an accuracy advantage of 20\% in case of vertically split data and 5\% in case of horizontally split data over imputing data locally. In case of the worst data split we observed that imputing using our method resulted in an increase of up to 32.7 times in the quality of imputation over the vertically split data and 3.4 times in case of horizontally split data. Our protocols are very efficient and run in 2.4 seconds in case of vertically split data and 8.4 seconds in case of horizontally split data for 100,000 records evaluated in the 10 Gbps network setting, performing one data imputation.",2025-11-25 20:31:05+00:00,2025-11-25 20:31:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20832v1
Quantum-Resistant Authentication Scheme for RFID Systems Using Lattice-Based Cryptography,"We propose a novel quantum-resistant mutual authentication scheme for radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels.",2025-11-25 18:49:29+00:00,2025-11-25 18:49:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20630v1
"Quantum Key Distribution: Bridging Theoretical Security Proofs, Practical Attacks, and Error Correction for Quantum-Augmented Networks","Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.",2025-11-25 18:31:02+00:00,2025-11-25 18:31:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20602v1
"Engel p-adic Isogeny-based Cryptography over Laurent Series: Foundations, Security, and an ESP32 Implementation","Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) against quantum attacks requires public-key cryptography that (i) remains compact and (ii) runs efficiently on microcontrollers, capabilities many post-quantum (PQ) schemes lack due to large keys and heavy arithmetic. We address both constraints simultaneously with, to our knowledge, the first-ever isogeny framework that encodes super-singular elliptic-curve isogeny data via novel Engel expansions over the p-adic Laurent series. Engel coefficients compress torsion information, thereby addressing the compactness constraint, yielding public keys of ~1.1 - 16.9 kbits preserving the hallmark small sizes of isogeny systems. Engel arithmetic is local and admits fixed-precision p-adic operations, enabling micro-controller efficiency with low-memory, branch-regular kernels suitable for embedded targets.",2025-11-25 17:35:54+00:00,2025-11-25 17:35:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20533v1
A Reality Check on SBOM-based Vulnerability Management: An Empirical Study and A Path Forward,"The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical tool for securing the software supply chain (SSC), but its practical utility is undermined by inaccuracies in both its generation and its application in vulnerability scanning. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, establishing a reliable foundation for security analysis. Using this high-fidelity foundation, however, we expose a more fundamental flaw in practice: downstream vulnerability scanners produce a staggering 97.5\% false positive rate. We pinpoint the primary cause as the flagging of vulnerabilities within unreachable code. We then demonstrate that function call analysis can effectively prune 63.3\% of these false alarms. Our work validates a practical, two-stage approach for SSC security: first, generate an accurate SBOM using lock files and strong package managers, and second, enrich it with function call analysis to produce actionable, low-noise vulnerability reports that alleviate developers' alert fatigue.",2025-11-25 13:52:16+00:00,2025-11-25 13:52:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20313v1
Improving the Identification of Real-world Malware's DNS Covert Channels Using Locality Sensitive Hashing,"Nowadays, malware increasingly uses DNS-based covert channels in order to evade detection and maintain stealthy communication with its command-and-control servers. While prior work has focused on detecting such activity, identifying specific malware families and their behaviors from captured network traffic remains challenging due to the variability of DNS. In this paper, we present the first application of Locality Sensitive Hashing to the detection and identification of real-world malware utilizing DNS covert channels. Our approach encodes DNS subdomain sequences into statistical similarity features that effectively capture anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Combined with a Random Forest classifier, our method achieves higher accuracy and reduced false positive rates than prior approaches, while demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to previously unseen or modified malware samples. We further demonstrate that our approach enables reliable classification of malware behavior (e.g., uploading or downloading of files), based solely on DNS subdomains.",2025-11-25 12:00:58+00:00,2025-11-25 12:00:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20229v1
On the Feasibility of Hijacking MLLMs' Decision Chain via One Perturbation,"Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.   This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying ""non-motorized lane"" signs as ""motorized lane"" and ""pedestrian"" as ""plastic bag"".   To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.",2025-11-25 07:13:13+00:00,2025-11-25 07:13:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20002v1
Cross-LLM Generalization of Behavioral Backdoor Detection in AI Agent Supply Chains,"As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.",2025-11-25 03:33:04+00:00,2025-11-25 03:33:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19874v1
Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?,"In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.",2025-11-24 22:32:03+00:00,2025-11-24 22:32:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710v1
DUALGUAGE: Automated Joint Security-Functionality Benchmarking for Secure Code Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.",2025-11-24 22:26:14+00:00,2025-11-24 22:26:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20709v1
Prompt Fencing: A Cryptographic Approach to Establishing Security Boundaries in Large Language Model Prompts,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.",2025-11-24 21:44:33+00:00,2025-11-24 21:44:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19727v1
Accuracy and Efficiency Trade-Offs in LLM-Based Malware Detection and Explanation: A Comparative Study of Parameter Tuning vs. Full Fine-Tuning,"This study examines whether Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can approximate the performance of fully fine-tuned models in generating human-interpretable decisions and explanations for malware classification. Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.",2025-11-24 19:37:13+00:00,2025-11-24 19:37:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19654v1
Synthetic Data: AI's New Weapon Against Android Malware,"The ever-increasing number of Android devices and the accelerated evolution of malware, reaching over 35 million samples by 2024, highlight the critical importance of effective detection methods. Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.",2025-11-24 19:27:58+00:00,2025-11-24 19:27:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19649v1
Medusa: Cross-Modal Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

FedPoisonTTP: A Threat Model and Poisoning Attack for Federated Test-Time Personalization,"Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.",2025-11-24 16:02:01+00:00,2025-11-24 16:02:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19248v1
Adversarial Attack-Defense Co-Evolution for LLM Safety Alignment via Tree-Group Dual-Aware Search and Optimization,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement.

We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code.

AttackPilot: Autonomous Inference Attacks Against ML Services With LLM-Based Agents,"Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.",2025-11-24 10:14:14+00:00,2025-11-24 10:14:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19536v1
Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Exploits with Responsible AI Considerations,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

RoguePrompt: Dual-Layer Ciphering for Self-Reconstruction to Circumvent LLM Moderation,"Content moderation pipelines for modern large language models combine static filters, dedicated moderation services, and alignment tuned base models, yet real world deployments still exhibit dangerous failure modes. This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone.",2025-11-24 05:42:54+00:00,2025-11-24 05:42:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18790v1
TASO: Jailbreak LLMs via Alternative Template and Suffix Optimization,"Many recent studies showed that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where an attacker can perturb the input of an LLM to induce it to generate an output for a harmful question. In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., ""Sure"").   In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses. Thus, they can be combined to improve the attack's effectiveness.   We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek). The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs. We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction.",2025-11-26 02:49:38+00:00,2025-11-23 18:49:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18581v2
"Zero-Trust Strategies for O-RAN Cellular Networks: Principles, Challenges and Research Directions","Cellular networks have become foundational to modern communication, supporting a broad range of applications, from civilian use to enterprise systems and military tactical networks. The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler. We analyze how ZTA principles align with the architectural and operational characteristics of O-RAN, and identify key challenges and opportunities for embedding zero-trust mechanisms within O-RAN-based cellular networks.",2025-11-23 18:25:19+00:00,2025-11-23 18:25:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18568v1
DEXO: A Secure and Fair Exchange Mechanism for Decentralized IoT Data Markets,"Opening up data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices for public utilization can maximize their economic value. Challenges remain in the trustworthiness of the data sources and the security of the trading process, particularly when there is no trust between the data providers and consumers. In this paper, we propose DEXO, a decentralized data exchange mechanism that facilitates secure and fair data exchange between data consumers and distributed IoT/mobile data providers at scale, allowing the consumer to verify the data generation process and the providers to be compensated for providing authentic data, with correctness guarantees from the exchange platform. To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion. We implemented a prototype of the DEXO system to demonstrate feasibility. The evaluation shows a moderate deployment cost and significantly improved blockchain operation efficiency compared to a popular data exchange mechanism.",2025-11-23 15:29:24+00:00,2025-11-23 15:29:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18498v1
Shadows in the Code: Exploring the Risks and Defenses of LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Development Systems,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.",2025-11-23 14:26:35+00:00,2025-11-23 14:26:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18467v1
Vision Token Masking Alone Cannot Prevent PHI Leakage in Medical Document OCR: A Systematic Evaluation,"Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.",2025-11-23 03:45:22+00:00,2025-11-23 03:45:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272v1
Carbon-Aware Intrusion Detection: A Comparative Study of Supervised and Unsupervised DRL for Sustainable IoT Edge Gateways,"The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified cybersecurity challenges, particularly in mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at the network edge. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) face significant limitations, including poor adaptability to evolving and zero-day attacks, reliance on static signatures and labeled datasets, and inefficiency on resource-constrained edge gateways. Moreover, most existing DRL-based IDS studies overlook sustainability factors such as energy efficiency and carbon impact. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS: DeepEdgeIDS, an unsupervised Autoencoder-DRL hybrid, and AutoDRL-IDS, a supervised LSTM-DRL model. Both DRL-based IDS are validated through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on edge gateways. Results demonstrate that AutoDRL-IDS achieves 94% detection accuracy using labeled data, while DeepEdgeIDS attains 98% accuracy and adaptability without labels. Distinctly, this study introduces a carbon-aware, multi-objective reward function optimized for sustainable and real-time IDS operations in dynamic IoT networks.",2025-11-23 00:59:27+00:00,2025-11-23 00:59:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18240v1
Lightweight Autoencoder-Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection for Green IoT Edge Gateways,"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to highly diverse and interconnected ecosystems that are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \textit{Autoencoder(AE)}-based representation learning with \textit{Isolation Forest(IF)} anomaly scoring. Beyond empirical performance, EcoDefender is supported by a theoretical foundation that establishes formal guarantees for its stability, convergence, robustness, and energy-complexity coupling-thereby linking computational behavior to energy efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on realistic IoT traffic confirm these theoretical insights, achieving up to 94\% detection accuracy with an average CPU usage of only 22\%, 27 ms inference latency, and 30\% lower energy consumption compared to AE-only baselines. By embedding sustainability metrics directly into the security evaluation process, this work demonstrates that reliable anomaly detection and environmental responsibility can coexist within next-generation green IoT infrastructures, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9: resilient infrastructure, SDG 13: climate action).",2025-11-23 00:48:34+00:00,2025-11-23 00:48:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18235v1
Think Fast: Real-Time IoT Intrusion Reasoning Using IDS and LLMs at the Edge Gateway,"As the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow, securing these systems against cyber threats remains a major challenge, especially in environments with limited computational and energy resources. This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.",2025-11-23 00:33:51+00:00,2025-11-23 00:33:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18230v1
Utilizing Circulant Structure to Optimize the Implementations of Linear Layers,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for optimizing the linear layer used in symmetric cryptography. It is observed that these matrices often have circulant structure. The basic idea of this work is to utilize the property to construct a sequence of transformation matrices, which allows subsequent heuristic algorithms to find more efficient implementations. Our results outperform previous works for various linear layers of block ciphers. For Whirlwind M0 , we obtain two implementations with 159 XOR counts (8% better than Yuan et al. at FSE 2025) and depth 17 (39% better than Shi et al. at AsiaCrypt 2024) respectively. For AES MixColumn, our automated method produces a quantum circuit with depth 10, which nearly matches the manually optimized state-of-the-art result by Zhang et al. at IEEE TC 2024, only with 2 extra CNOTs.",2025-11-23 00:05:06+00:00,2025-11-23 00:05:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18226v1
A Novel and Practical Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Deep Reinforcement Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.",2025-11-22 23:52:01+00:00,2025-11-22 23:52:01+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18223v1
eBPF-PATROL: Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation using eBPF in Containerized and Virtualized Environments,"With the increasing use and adoption of cloud and cloud-native computing, the underlying technologies (i.e., containerization and virtualization) have become foundational. However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (< 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.",2025-11-22 18:51:36+00:00,2025-11-22 18:51:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18155v1
ASTRA: Agentic Steerability and Risk Assessment Framework,"Securing AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents one of the most critical challenges in AI security today. Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their ""brain"" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., ""Do not send an email out of the company domain,"" or ""Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters"").   Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries. The purpose of this work is to provide the community with a robust and unified methodology to build and validate better LLMs, ultimately pushing for more secure and reliable agentic AI systems.",2025-11-22 16:32:29+00:00,2025-11-22 16:32:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18114v1
Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy,"Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.",2025-11-22 11:28:59+00:00,2025-11-22 11:28:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18025v1
Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks,"Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.",2025-11-22 09:04:58+00:00,2025-11-22 09:04:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989v1
"Towards Effective, Stealthy, and Persistent Backdoor Attacks Targeting Graph Foundation Models","Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.",2025-11-22 08:52:09+00:00,2025-11-22 08:52:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982v1
Towards Automating Data Access Permissions in AI Agents,"As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.",2025-11-22 07:50:43+00:00,2025-11-22 07:50:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17959v1
Homomorphic Encryption-based Vaults for Anonymous Balances on VM-enabled Blockchains,"In this work, we present homomorphic encryption-based vaults (Haults), a permissioned privacy-preserving smart wallet protocol for VM-enabled blockchains that keeps users' balances confidential, as well as the amounts transacted to other parties. To comply with regulations, we include optional compliance features that allow specific entities (the auditors) to retrieve transaction amounts or execute force transfers when necessary. Our solution uses ElGamal over elliptic curves to encrypt balances, combined with zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of transaction amounts and the integrity of the sender's updated balance, among other security checks. We provide a detailed explanation of the protocol, including a security discussion and benchmarks from our proof-of-concept implementation, which yield great results. Beyond in-contract issued tokens, we also provide a thorough explanation on how our solution can be compatible with external ones (e.g., Ether or any ERC20).",2025-11-21 23:34:30+00:00,2025-11-21 23:34:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17842v1
"StealthCup: Realistic, Multi-Stage, Evasion-Focused CTF for Benchmarking IDS","Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical to defending enterprise and industrial control environments, yet evaluating their effectiveness under realistic conditions remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.",2025-11-21 20:17:59+00:00,2025-11-21 20:17:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17761v1
The Dark Side of Flexibility: How Aggregated Cyberattacks Threaten the Power Grid,"Flexible energy resources are increasingly becoming common in smart grids. These resources are typically managed and controlled by aggregators that coordinate many resources to provide flexibility services. However, these aggregators and flexible energy resources are vulnerable, which could allow attackers to remotely control flexible energy resources to launch large-scale attacks on the grid. This paper investigates and evaluates the potential attack strategies that can be used to manipulate flexible energy resources to challenge the effectiveness of traditional grid stability measures and disrupt the first-swing stability of the power grid. Our work shows that although a large amount of power is required, the current flexibility capacities could potentially be sufficient to disrupt the grid on a national level.",2025-11-21 19:59:45+00:00,2025-11-21 19:59:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17748v1
Temperature in SLMs: Impact on Incident Categorization in On-Premises Environments,"SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures. The results indicate that temperature has little influence on performance, whereas the number of parameters and GPU capacity are decisive factors.",2025-11-21 19:37:09+00:00,2025-11-21 19:37:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19464v1
A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control,"We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.",2025-11-21 18:09:25+00:00,2025-11-21 18:09:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464v1
Persistent BitTorrent Trackers,"Private BitTorrent trackers enforce upload-to-download ratios to prevent free-riding, but suffer from three critical weaknesses: reputation cannot move between trackers, centralized servers create single points of failure, and upload statistics are self-reported and unverifiable. When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\times$.",2025-11-24 14:24:05+00:00,2025-11-21 14:06:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17260v2
Steering in the Shadows: Causal Amplification for Activation Space Attacks in Large Language Models,"Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically secured by auditing data, prompts, and refusal policies, while treating the forward pass as an implementation detail. We show that intermediate activations in decoder-only LLMs form a vulnerable attack surface for behavioral control. Building on recent findings on attention sinks and compression valleys, we identify a high-gain region in the residual stream where small, well-aligned perturbations are causally amplified along the autoregressive trajectory--a Causal Amplification Effect (CAE). We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.",2025-11-21 12:19:55+00:00,2025-11-21 12:19:55+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17194v1
A Robust Federated Learning Approach for Combating Attacks Against IoT Systems Under non-IID Challenges,"In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.",2025-11-20 22:05:14+00:00,2025-11-20 22:05:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16822v1
Password Strength Analysis Through Social Network Data Exposure: A Combined Approach Relying on Data Reconstruction and Generative Models,"Although passwords remain the primary defense against unauthorized access, users often tend to use passwords that are easy to remember. This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.",2025-11-20 18:34:33+00:00,2025-11-20 18:34:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16716v1
Auditable Ledger Snapshot for Non-Repudiable Cross-Blockchain Communication,"Blockchain interoperability is increasingly recognized as the centerpiece for robust interactions among decentralized services. Blockchain ledgers are generally tamper-proof and thus enforce non-repudiation for transactions recorded within the same network. However, such a guarantee does not hold for cross-blockchain transactions. When disruptions occur due to malicious activities or system failures within one blockchain network, foreign networks can take advantage by denying legitimate claims or mounting fraudulent liabilities against the defenseless network. In response, this paper introduces InterSnap, a novel blockchain snapshot archival methodology, for enabling auditability of crossblockchain transactions, enforcing non-repudiation. InterSnap introduces cross-chain transaction receipts that ensure their irrefutability. Snapshots of ledger data along with these receipts are utilized as non-repudiable proof of bilateral agreements among different networks. InterSnap enhances system resilience through a distributed snapshot generation process, need-based snapshot scheduling process, and archival storage and sharing via decentralized platforms. Through a prototype implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, we conducted experiments using on-premise machines, AWS public cloud instances, as well as a private cloud infrastructure. We establish that InterSnap can recover from malicious attacks while preserving crosschain transaction receipts. Additionally, our proposed solution demonstrates adaptability to increasing loads while securely transferring snapshot archives with minimal overhead.",2025-11-20 17:13:06+00:00,2025-11-20 17:13:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16560v1
Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks,"This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.",2025-11-20 15:36:57+00:00,2025-11-20 15:36:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1
Optimal Fairness under Local Differential Privacy,"We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.",2025-11-20 14:00:15+00:00,2025-11-20 14:00:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16377v1
Multi-Domain Security for 6G ISAC: Challenges and Opportunities in Transportation,"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) will be central to 6G-enabled transportation, providing both seamless connectivity and high-precision sensing. However, this tight integration exposes attack points not encountered in pure sensing and communication systems. In this article, we identify unique ISAC-induced security challenges and opportunities in three interrelated domains: cyber-physical (where manipulation of sensors and actuators can mislead perception and control), physical-layer (where over-the-air signals are vulnerable to spoofing and jamming) and protocol (where complex cryptographic protocols cannot detect lower-layer attacks). Building on these insights, we put forward a multi-domain security vision for 6G transportation and propose an integrated security framework that unifies protection across domains.",2025-11-20 12:46:59+00:00,2025-11-20 12:46:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16316v1
"""To Survive, I Must Defect"": Jailbreaking LLMs via the Game-Theory Scenarios","As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture ""template-over-safety flip"": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.",2025-11-20 11:56:00+00:00,2025-11-20 11:56:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16278v1
PSM: Prompt Sensitivity Minimization via LLM-Guided Black-Box Optimization,"System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

ART: A Graph-based Framework for Investigating Illicit Activity in Monero via Address-Ring-Transaction Structures,"As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to ""mixin"" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems",2025-11-20 09:59:50+00:00,2025-11-20 09:59:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16192v1
Multi-Faceted Attack: Exposing Cross-Model Vulnerabilities in Defense-Equipped Vision-Language Models,"The growing misuse of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has led providers to deploy multiple safeguards, including alignment tuning, system prompts, and content moderation. However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack",2025-11-20 07:12:54+00:00,2025-11-20 07:12:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16110v1
Scalable Privilege Analysis for Multi-Cloud Big Data Platforms: A Hypergraph Approach,"The rapid adoption of multi-cloud environments has amplified risks associated with privileged access mismanagement. Traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) exhibit cubic O(n^3) complexity, rendering real-time privilege analysis intractable at enterprise scale. We present a novel PAM framework integrating NIST's Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) with hypergraph semantics to address this scalability crisis. Our approach leverages hypergraphs with labeled hyperedges to model complex, multi-dimensional privilege relationships, achieving sub-linear O(sqrt n) traversal complexity and O(nlogn) detection time-rigorously proven through formal complexity analysis. We introduce a 3-Dimensional Privilege Analysis framework encompassing Attack Surface, Attack Window, and Attack Identity to systematically identify privilege vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on AWS-based systems with 200-4000 users demonstrates 10x improvement over ABAC and 4x improvement over standard NGAC-DAG, enabling sub-second privilege detection at scale. Real-world use cases validate detection of privilege escalation chains, over-privileged users, and lateral movement pathways in multi-cloud infrastructures.",2025-11-19 19:53:15+00:00,2025-11-19 19:53:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15837v1
Event-based Data Format Standard (EVT+),"Event-based Sensing (EBS) hardware is quickly proliferating while finding foothold in many commercial, industrial, and defense applications. At present, there are a handful of technologically mature systems which produce data streams with diverse output formats. In the near future it is anticipated there will be vendors who offer new sensor hardware which could also yield unique data schema that are not aligned to past efforts. Thus, due to the relative nascent nature of the technology and its potential for widespread use in a variety of applications, it is an opportune time to define a standard for this class of sensors' output data. The intent of this document is to identify and provide a standard for the collected EBS streaming data. The main objective of the standard is to be sensor agnostic, incorporate some of the current sensor configurations and modalities, and account for the developing configurations and modalities. The intent is also to leave enough place holders and space in the standard for future variations that may develop as EBS technology matures.",2025-11-19 15:49:06+00:00,2025-11-19 15:49:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15556v1
Towards a Formal Verification of Secure Vehicle Software Updates,"With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.   Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.",2025-11-19 14:35:30+00:00,2025-11-19 14:35:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479v1
How To Cook The Fragmented Rug Pull?,"Existing rug pull detectors assume a simple workflow: the deployer keeps liquidity pool (LP) tokens and performs one or a few large sells (within a day) that collapse the pool and cash out. In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.   We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).   We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.",2025-11-19 14:22:07+00:00,2025-11-19 14:22:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15463v1
When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit,"We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.",2025-11-19 13:19:54+00:00,2025-11-19 13:19:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1
Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin,"The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.",2025-11-19 09:41:25+00:00,2025-11-19 09:41:25+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278v1
"QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting","The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.",2025-11-19 09:37:19+00:00,2025-11-19 09:37:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272v1
MAIF: Enforcing AI Trust and Provenance with an Artifact-Centric Agentic Paradigm,"The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.",2025-11-24 02:26:39+00:00,2025-11-19 04:10:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15097v2
Towards Practical Zero-Knowledge Proof for PSPACE,"Efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been restricted to NP statements so far, whereas they exist for all statements in PSPACE. This work presents the first practical zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for PSPACE-complete statements by enabling ZK proofs of QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) evaluation. The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL. The results show that our protocols can verify 72% of QBF evaluations via Q-Res proof and 82% of instances' winning strategies within 100 seconds, for instances where such proofs or strategies can be obtained.",2025-11-19 03:22:48+00:00,2025-11-19 03:22:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15071v1
Towards Classifying Benign And Malicious Packages Using Machine Learning,"Recently, the number of malicious open-source packages in package repositories has been increasing dramatically. While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.",2025-11-19 01:59:11+00:00,2025-11-19 01:59:11+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15033v1
LFreeDA: Label-Free Drift Adaptation for Windows Malware Detection,"Machine learning (ML)-based malware detectors degrade over time as concept drift introduces new and evolving families unseen during training. Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.",2025-11-18 23:08:26+00:00,2025-11-18 23:08:26+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14963v1
On-Premise SLMs vs. Commercial LLMs: Prompt Engineering and Incident Classification in SOCs and CSIRTs,"In this study, we evaluate open-source models for security incident classification, comparing them with proprietary models. We utilize a dataset of anonymized real incidents, categorized according to the NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy and processed using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, and ZSL). The results indicate that, although proprietary models still exhibit higher accuracy, locally deployed open-source models provide advantages in privacy, cost-effectiveness, and data sovereignty.",2025-11-18 20:56:49+00:00,2025-11-18 20:56:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14908v1

Attacking Autonomous Driving Agents with Adversarial Machine Learning: A Holistic Evaluation with the CARLA Leaderboard,"To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.   To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.   We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.",2025-11-18 19:49:46+00:00,2025-11-18 19:49:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14876v1
A Unified Compositional View of Attack Tree Metrics,"Attack trees (ATs) are popular graphical models for reasoning about the security of complex systems, allowing for the quantification of risk through so-called AT metrics. A large variety of different such AT metrics have been proposed, and despite their wide-spread practical use, no systematic treatment of attack tree metrics so far is fully satisfactory. Existing approaches either fail to include important metrics, or they are too general to provide a useful systematic way for defining concrete AT metrics, giving only an abstract characterisation of their behaviour. We solve this problem by developing a compositional theory of ATs and their functorial semantics based on gs-monoidal categories. Viewing attack trees as string diagrams, we show that components of ATs form a channel category, a particular type of gs-monoidal category. AT metrics then correspond to functors of channel categories. This characterisation is both general enough to include all common AT metrics, and concrete enough to define AT metrics by their logical structure.",2025-11-18 17:59:44+00:00,2025-11-18 17:59:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14717v1
FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE",2025-11-19 11:55:52+00:00,2025-11-18 17:57:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2
SecureSign: Bridging Security and UX in Mobile Web3 through Emulated EIP-6963 Sandboxing,"Mobile Web3 faces catastrophic retention (< 5%) yielding effective acquisition costs of \$500 - \$1,000 per retained user. Existing solutions force an impossible tradeoff: embedded wallets achieve moderate usability but suffer inherent click-jacking vulnerabilities; app wallets maintain security at the cost of 2 - 3% retention due to download friction and context-switching penalties. We present SecureSign, a PWA-based architecture that adapts desktop browser extension security to mobile via EIP-6963 provider sandboxing. SecureSign isolates dApp execution in iframes within a trusted parent application, achieving click-jacking immunity and transaction integrity while enabling native mobile capabilities (push notifications, home screen installation, zero context-switching). Our drop-in SDK requires no codebase changes for existing Web3 applications. Threat model analysis demonstrates immunity to click-jacking, overlay, and skimming attacks while maintaining wallet interoperability across dApps.",2025-11-18 16:02:46+00:00,2025-11-18 16:02:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14611v1
ForensicFlow: A Tri-Modal Adaptive Network for Robust Deepfake Detection,"Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines.

Steganographic Backdoor Attacks in NLP: Ultra-Low Poisoning and Defense Evasion,"Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.",2025-11-25 07:42:59+00:00,2025-11-18 09:56:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14301v2
Beyond Fixed and Dynamic Prompts: Embedded Jailbreak Templates for Advancing LLM Security,"As the use of large language models (LLMs) continues to expand, ensuring their safety and robustness has become a critical challenge. In particular, jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a tangible threat across industries, driving the need for diverse templates to support red-teaming efforts and strengthen defensive techniques. However, current approaches predominantly rely on two limited strategies: (i) substituting harmful queries into fixed templates, and (ii) having the LLM generate entire templates, which often compromises intent clarity and reproductibility. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Embedded Jailbreak Template, which preserves the structure of existing templates while naturally embedding harmful queries within their context. We further propose a progressive prompt-engineering methodology to ensure template quality and consistency, alongside standardized protocols for generation and evaluation. Together, these contributions provide a benchmark that more accurately reflects real-world usage scenarios and harmful intent, facilitating its application in red-teaming and policy regression testing.",2025-11-18 04:59:10+00:00,2025-11-18 04:59:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14140v1
A Fuzzy Logic-Based Cryptographic Framework For Real-Time Dynamic Key Generation For Enhanced Data Encryption,"With the ever-growing demand for cybersecurity, static key encryption mechanisms are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their deterministic and non-adaptive nature. Brute-force attacks, key compromise, and unauthorized access have become highly common cyber threats. This research presents a novel fuzzy logic-based cryptographic framework that dynamically generates encryption keys in real-time by accessing system-level entropy and hardware-bound trust. The proposed system leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate system parameters that include CPU utilization, process count, and timestamp variation. It assigns entropy level based on linguistically defined fuzzy rules which are fused with hardware-generated randomness and then securely sealed using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The sealed key is incorporated in an AES-GCM encryption scheme to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of the data. This system introduces a scalable solution for adaptive encryption in high-assurance computing, zero-trust environments, and cloud-based infrastructure.",2025-11-18 04:34:31+00:00,2025-11-18 04:34:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14132v1
Observational Auditing of Label Privacy,"Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.",2025-11-18 03:12:59+00:00,2025-11-18 03:12:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14084v1
Hardness of Range Avoidance and Proof Complexity Generators from Demi-Bits,"Given a circuit $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ with $m > n$, the *range avoidance* problem ($\text{Avoid}$) asks to output a string $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$ that is not in the range of $G$. Besides its profound connection to circuit complexity and explicit construction problems, this problem is also related to the existence of *proof complexity generators* -- circuits $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ where $m > n$ but for every $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$, it is infeasible to prove the statement ""$y\not\in\mathrm{Range}(G)$"" in a given propositional proof system.   This paper connects these two problems with the existence of *demi-bits generators*, a fundamental cryptographic primitive against nondeterministic adversaries introduced by Rudich (RANDOM '97).   $\bullet$ We show that the existence of demi-bits generators implies $\text{Avoid}$ is hard for nondeterministic algorithms. This resolves an open problem raised by Chen and Li (STOC '24). Furthermore, assuming the demi-hardness of certain LPN-style generators or Goldreich' PRG, we prove the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ even when the instances are constant-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$.   $\bullet$ We show that the dual weak pigeonhole principle is unprovable in Cook's theory $\mathsf{PV}_1$ under the existence of demi-bits generators secure against $\mathbf{AM}$, thereby separating Jerabek's theory $\mathsf{APC}_1$ from $\mathsf{PV}_1$.   $\bullet$ We transform demi-bits generators to proof complexity generators that are *pseudo-surjective* with nearly optimal parameters.   Our constructions build on the recent breakthroughs on the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ by Ilango, Li, and Williams (STOC '23) and Chen and Li (STOC '24). We use *randomness extractors* to significantly simplify the construction and the proof.",2025-11-18 02:40:39+00:00,2025-11-18 02:40:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14061v1
GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.   To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.",2025-11-18 01:51:34+00:00,2025-11-18 01:51:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14045v1
On the Gradient Complexity of Private Optimization with Private Oracles,"We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.",2025-11-17 23:58:11+00:00,2025-11-17 23:58:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13999v1
A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms,"This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability.

TZ-LLM: Protecting On-Device Large Language Models with Arm TrustZone,"Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices offer benefits like user privacy and reduced network latency, but introduce a significant security risk: the leakage of proprietary models to end users.   To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.   Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.   We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.",2025-11-17 18:59:20+00:00,2025-11-17 18:59:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13717v1
Robust Client-Server Watermarking for Split Federated Learning,"Split Federated Learning (SFL) is renowned for its privacy-preserving nature and low computational overhead among decentralized machine learning paradigms. In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks.",2025-11-17 16:58:33+00:00,2025-11-17 16:58:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13598v1
Exploring the Effectiveness of Google Play Store's Privacy Transparency Channels,"With the requirements and emphases on privacy transparency placed by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, the Google Play Store requires Android developers to more responsibly communicate their apps' privacy practices to potential users by providing the proper information via the data safety, privacy policy, and permission manifest privacy transparency channels. However, it is unclear how effective those channels are in helping users make informed decisions in the app selection and installation process. In this article, we conducted a study for 190 participants to interact with our simulated privacy transparency channels of mobile apps. We quantitatively analyzed (supplemented by qualitative analysis) participants' responses to five sets of questions. We found that data safety provides the most intuitive user interfaces, privacy policy is most informative and effective, while permission manifest excels at raising participants' concerns about an app's overall privacy risks. These channels complement each other and should all be improved.",2025-11-17 16:40:19+00:00,2025-11-17 16:40:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13576v1
ForgeDAN: An Evolutionary Framework for Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models,"The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.",2025-11-17 16:19:21+00:00,2025-11-17 16:19:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13548v1
InfoDecom: Decomposing Information for Defending against Privacy Leakage in Split Inference,"Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines.

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.",2025-11-17 13:04:36+00:00,2025-11-17 13:04:36+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13329v1
Whistledown: Combining User-Level Privacy with Conversational Coherence in LLMs,"Users increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for personal, emotionally charged, and socially sensitive conversations. However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making.   In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.",2025-11-17 12:56:33+00:00,2025-11-17 12:56:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13319v1
SoK: The Last Line of Defense: On Backdoor Defense Evaluation,"Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models by implanting hidden vulnerabilities that can be activated by malicious inputs. While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses.   Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems.",2025-11-17 08:51:18+00:00,2025-11-17 08:51:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13143v1
VEIL: Jailbreaking Text-to-Video Models via Visual Exploitation from Implicit Language,"Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.",2025-11-17 08:31:43+00:00,2025-11-17 08:31:43+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127v1
SafeGRPO: Self-Rewarded Multimodal Safety Alignment via Rule-Governed Policy Optimization,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, yet their expanded modality space introduces new compositional safety risks that emerge from complex text-image interactions. Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.",2025-11-17 05:09:49+00:00,2025-11-17 05:09:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12982v1
"The Grain Family of Stream Ciphers: an Abstraction, Strengthening of Components and New Concrete Instantiations","The first contribution of the paper is to put forward an abstract definition of the Grain family of stream ciphers which formalises the different components that are required to specify a particular member of the family. Our second contribution is to provide new and strengthened definitions of the components. These include definining new classes of nonlinear Boolean functions, improved definition of the state update function during initialisation, choice of the tap positions, and the possibility of the linear feedback shift register being smaller than the nonlinear feedback shift register. The third contribution of the paper is to put forward seven concrete proposals of stream ciphers by suitably instantiating the abstract family, one at the 80-bit security level, and two each at the 128-bit, 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels. At the 80-bit security level, compared to the well known Grain~v1, the new proposal uses Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties \textit{and} an overall lower gate count. At the 128-bit level, compared to ISO/IEC standard Grain-128a, the new proposals use Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties; one of the proposals require a few extra gates, while the other has an overall lower gate count. At the 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels, there are no proposals in the literature with smaller gate counts.",2025-11-17 05:08:32+00:00,2025-11-17 05:08:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12981v1
Telekommunikationsüberwachung am Scheideweg: Zur Regulierbarkeit des Zugriffes auf verschlüsselte Kommunikation,"Personal communication using technical means is protected by telecommunications secrecy. Any interference with this fundamental right requires a legal basis, which has existed for many years for traditional communication services in the form of telecommunications surveillance (TKÜ, § 100a StPO) and appears to be widely accepted by society. The basis for the implementation of TKÜ is the obligation of telecommunications providers to provide interception interfaces. However, the technical implementation of telecommunications has changed significantly as a result of the Internet. Messenger services and Voice over IP telephony are increasingly competing with traditional telephone services. The use of strong end-to-end encryption made possible by this technology is increasingly posing problems for law enforcement agencies, as only cryptographically encrypted content is accessible via the interception interfaces provided to date. Against the backdrop of current discussions on socalled ``chat control'' and its limited social acceptance, this article addresses the question of whether and, if so, how the cooperation obligations of the technical actors involved can be sensibly regulated in the case of encrypted communication.",2025-11-16 23:29:56+00:00,2025-11-16 23:29:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12830v1
Efficient Adversarial Malware Defense via Trust-Based Raw Override and Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction,"The deployment of robust malware detection systems in big data environments requires careful consideration of both security effectiveness and computational efficiency. While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs.",2025-11-16 23:21:44+00:00,2025-11-16 23:21:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12827v1
LLM Reinforcement in Context,Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.,2025-11-16 21:24:42+00:00,2025-11-16 21:24:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12782v1
"Cybersecurity of High-Altitude Platform Stations: Threat Taxonomy, Attacks and Defenses with Standards Mapping - DDoS Attack Use Case","High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging stratospheric nodes within non-terrestrial networks. We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance-while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation.",2025-11-16 20:28:58+00:00,2025-11-16 20:28:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12766v1
Whose Narrative is it Anyway? A KV Cache Manipulation Attack,"The Key Value(KV) cache is an important component for efficient inference in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), but its role as a representation of the model's internal state makes it a potential target for integrity attacks. This paper introduces ""History Swapping,"" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior.",2025-11-16 19:38:28+00:00,2025-11-16 19:38:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12752v1
An Evaluation Framework for Network IDS/IPS Datasets: Leveraging MITRE ATT&CK and Industry Relevance Metrics,"The performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is critically dependent on the relevance and quality of the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.",2025-11-16 19:17:00+00:00,2025-11-16 19:17:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12743v1
Offensive tool determination strategy R.I.D.D.L.E. + (C),"Intentional threats are a major risk factor related to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure assets, and an accurate risk assessment is necessary to analyze threats, assess vulnerabilities, and evaluate potential impacts on assets and systems. This research proposes a methodology that can be added as an additional phase in the risk assessment process. The method introduces an extra analytical parameter concerning offensive tool characteristics, improving the understanding of intentional threats.   The methodology is presented using clear and accessible language suitable for a broad audience. It is based on an approach described as an ""offensive tool determination strategy,"" summarized by the acronym R.I.D.D.L.E.+C, which refers to the variables used in the analysis: resistance, intrusion timing, damage, disruption timing, latency, efficiency, and cost. These variables are evaluated using open-source intelligence.   Each variable is assigned a specific range of values according to its potential impact on the targeted asset. A matrix is then provided for practical application, which can reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and offer a more granular framework for decision-making and security planning.",2025-11-16 17:44:21+00:00,2025-11-16 17:44:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12704v1
The 'Sure' Trap: Multi-Scale Poisoning Analysis of Stealthy Compliance-Only Backdoors in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models,"Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response ""Sure"" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the ""Sure"" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.",2025-11-16 02:01:58+00:00,2025-11-16 02:01:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12414v1
GenSIaC: Toward Security-Aware Infrastructure-as-Code Generation with Large Language Models,"In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation. IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.   While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.   To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.",2025-11-15 23:23:52+00:00,2025-11-15 23:23:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12385v1
On the Security and Privacy of AI-based Mobile Health Chatbots,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has impacted the development of mobile health (mHealth) apps, most notably with the advent of AI-based chatbots used as ubiquitous ``companions'' for various services, from fitness to mental health assistants. While these mHealth chatbots offer clear benefits, such as personalized health information and predictive diagnoses, they also raise significant concerns regarding security and privacy. This study empirically assesses 16 AI-based mHealth chatbots identified from the Google Play Store. The empirical assessment follows a three-phase approach (manual inspection, static code analysis, and dynamic analysis) to evaluate technical robustness and how design and implementation choices impact end users. Our findings revealed security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling Remote WebView debugging), privacy issues, and non-compliance with Google Play policies (e.g., failure to provide publicly accessible privacy policies). Based on our findings, we offer several recommendations to enhance the security and privacy of mHealth chatbots. These recommendations focus on improving data handling processes, disclosure, and user security. Therefore, this work also seeks to support mHealth developers and security/privacy engineers in designing more transparent, privacy-friendly, and secure mHealth chatbots.",2025-11-15 22:49:07+00:00,2025-11-15 22:49:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12377v1
Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks,"Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $β$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.",2025-11-15 19:00:29+00:00,2025-11-15 19:00:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12325v1
An Improved Quantum Anonymous Notification Protocol for Quantum-Augmented Networks,"The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.",2025-11-15 17:59:11+00:00,2025-11-15 17:59:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12313v1
Calibrated Adversarial Sampling: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Generalization Against Unforeseen Attacks,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.",2025-11-15 15:42:40+00:00,2025-11-15 15:42:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12265v1
"eFPE: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Lightweight Format-Preserving Encryption Algorithm for Embedded Systems","Resource-constrained embedded systems demand secure yet lightweight data protection, particularly when data formats must be preserved.

Explainable Transformer-Based Email Phishing Classification with Adversarial Robustness,"Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.",2025-11-15 08:05:47+00:00,2025-11-15 08:05:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12085v1
ExplainableGuard: Interpretable Adversarial Defense for Large Language Models Using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can subtly manipulate their outputs. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action. We demonstrate how tailored CoT prompts guide the LLM to perform a multi-faceted analysis (character, word, structural, and semantic) and generate a purified output along with a human-readable justification. Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Movie Reviews dataset show promising defense efficacy. Additionally, a human evaluation study reveals that ExplainableGuard's explanations outperform ablated variants in clarity, specificity, and actionability, with a 72.5% deployability-trust rating, underscoring its potential for more trustworthy LLM deployments.",2025-11-15 06:11:07+00:00,2025-11-15 06:11:07+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13771v1
BudgetLeak: Membership Inference Attacks on RAG Systems via the Generation Budget Side Channel,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by integrating external knowledge, but reliance on proprietary or sensitive corpora poses various data risks, including privacy leakage and unauthorized data usage. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a common technique to assess such risks, yet existing approaches underperform in RAG due to black-box constraints and the absence of strong membership signals. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering. Extensive experiments across four datasets, three LLM generators, and two retrievers demonstrate that BudgetLeak consistently outperforms existing baselines, while maintaining high efficiency and practical viability. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked data risk in RAG systems and highlight the need for new defenses.",2025-11-15 05:25:04+00:00,2025-11-15 05:25:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12043v1
CITADEL: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Malware Detection Under Continuous Distribution Drift,"Android malware evolves rapidly, leading to concept drift that degrades the performance of traditional machine learning (ML)-based detection systems. While recent approaches incorporate active learning and hierarchical contrastive loss to handle this drift, they remain fully supervised, computationally expensive, and perform poorly on real-world datasets with long temporal spans. In particular, our evaluation highlights these limitations, particularly on LAMDA, a 12-year longitudinal dataset exhibiting substantial distributional shifts. Moreover, manual expert labeling cannot scale with the daily emergence of over 450,000 new malware samples, leaving most samples unlabeled and underutilized.   To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a robust semi-supervised active learning framework for Android malware detection. To bridge the gap between image-domain semi-supervised learning and binary feature representations of malware, we introduce malware-specific augmentations, Bernoulli bit flips and masking, that simulate realistic drift behaviors. CITADEL further integrates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under limited labeling budgets. Extensive evaluation on four large-scale Android malware benchmarks -- APIGraph, Chen-AZ, MaMaDroid, and LAMDA demonstrates that CITADEL outperforms prior work, achieving F1 score of over 1%, 3%, 7%, and 14% respectively, using only 40% labeled samples. Furthermore, CITADEL shows significant efficiency over prior work incurring $24\times$ faster training and $13\times$ fewer operations.",2025-11-15 01:34:15+00:00,2025-11-15 01:34:15+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11979v1
Binary BPE: A Family of Cross-Platform Tokenizers for Binary Analysis,"Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.",2025-11-14 22:53:03+00:00,2025-11-14 22:53:03+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573v1
On the Trade-Off Between Transparency and Security in Adversarial Machine Learning,"Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.",2025-11-14 20:05:50+00:00,2025-11-14 20:05:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11842v1
Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.",2025-11-14 19:56:52+00:00,2025-11-14 19:56:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11836v1
Private Frequency Estimation Via Residue Number Systems,"We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection} (SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $Θ\bigl(ω\log_2(k/ω)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $ω\approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $Θ(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = Θ(\log k)$), this becomes $Θ(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022) while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.",2025-11-17 10:42:09+00:00,2025-11-14 18:58:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11569v2
Grid-STIX: A STIX 2.1-Compliant Cyber-Physical Security Ontology for Power Grid,"Modern electrical power grids represent complex cyber-physical systems requiring specialized cybersecurity frameworks beyond traditional IT security models. Existing threat intelligence standards such as STIX 2.1 and MITRE ATT\&CK lack coverage for grid-specific assets, operational technology relationships, and cyber-physical interdependencies essential for power system security. We present Grid-STIX, a domain-specific extension of STIX 2.1 for electrical grid cybersecurity applications. Grid-STIX employs a modular architecture encompassing physical assets, operational technology components, cyber-physical relationships, and security policies that capture modern power systems including distributed energy resources, advanced metering infrastructure, and nuclear energy facilities. The framework provides threat modeling capabilities through systematic representation of attack patterns, supply chain risks, and cross-domain impact analysis while maintaining STIX 2.1 compliance. Grid-STIX includes modules for nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation verification, enabling cybersecurity modeling across conventional and nuclear energy sectors. The ontology supports Zero Trust enforcement through policy decision points and operational context integration.

"Privacy Challenges and Solutions in Retrieval-Augmented Generation-Enhanced LLMs for Healthcare Chatbots: A Review of Applications, Risks, and Future Directions","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.",2025-11-17 03:23:50+00:00,2025-11-14 14:33:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11347v2
The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security,"Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography.   In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.",2025-11-14 13:26:36+00:00,2025-11-14 13:26:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292v1
SQuaD: The Software Quality Dataset,"Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics.

Prompt Engineering vs. Fine-Tuning for LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection in Solana and Algorand Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts have emerged as key components within decentralized environments, enabling the automation of transactions through self-executing programs. While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.",2025-11-14 12:50:36+00:00,2025-11-14 12:50:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11250v1
Automata-Based Steering of Large Language Models for Diverse Structured Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.",2025-11-14 07:10:23+00:00,2025-11-14 07:10:23+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11018v1
Robustness of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction under data security threats,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.",2025-11-14 03:26:51+00:00,2025-11-14 03:26:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13753v1
Armadillo: Robust Single-Server Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning with Input Validation,"This paper presents a secure aggregation system Armadillo that has disruptive resistance against adversarial clients, such that any coalition of malicious clients (within the tolerated threshold) can affect the aggregation result only by misreporting their private inputs in a pre-defined legitimate range. Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.",2025-11-14 00:16:53+00:00,2025-11-14 00:16:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10863v1
Can AI Models be Jailbroken to Phish Elderly Victims? An End-to-End Evaluation,"We present an end-to-end demonstration of how attackers can exploit AI safety failures to harm vulnerable populations: from jailbreaking LLMs to generate phishing content, to deploying those messages against real targets, to successfully compromising elderly victims. We systematically evaluated safety guardrails across six frontier LLMs spanning four attack categories, revealing critical failures where several models exhibited near-complete susceptibility to certain attack vectors. In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient.",2025-11-13 23:16:41+00:00,2025-11-13 23:16:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11759v1
AFLGopher: Accelerating Directed Fuzzing via Feasibility-Aware Guidance,"Directed fuzzing is a useful testing technique that aims to efficiently reach target code sites in a program. The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \emph{feasibility-unaware}.   In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets. AFLGopher is 5.60x, 5.20x, 4.98x, 4.52x, and 5.07x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in triggering known vulnerabilities.",2025-11-13 22:02:05+00:00,2025-11-13 22:02:05+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10828v1
PISanitizer: Preventing Prompt Injection to Long-Context LLMs via Prompt Sanitization,"Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.",2025-11-13 18:56:20+00:00,2025-11-13 18:56:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10720v1
zkStruDul: Programming zkSNARKs with Structural Duality,"Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.",2025-11-13 18:06:21+00:00,2025-11-13 18:06:21+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10565v1
On the Detectability of Active Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning,"One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.",2025-11-13 17:06:57+00:00,2025-11-13 17:06:57+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10502v1
Enhanced Privacy Leakage from Noise-Perturbed Gradients via Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models,"Federated learning synchronizes models through gradient transmission and aggregation. However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients, without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of the attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.",2025-11-16 12:37:26+00:00,2025-11-13 15:43:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10423v2
Pack-A-Mal: A Malware Analysis Framework for Open-Source Packages,"The increasingly sophisticated environment in which attackers operate makes software security an even greater challenge in open-source projects, where malicious packages are prevalent. Static analysis tools, such as Malcontent, are highly useful but are often incapable of dealing with obfuscated malware. Such situations lead to an unreasonably high rate of false positives. This paper highlights that dynamic analysis, rather than static analysis, provides greater insight but is also more resource-intensive for understanding software behaviour during execution. In this study, we enhance a dynamic analysis tool, package-analysis, to capture key runtime behaviours, including commands executed, files accessed, and network communications. This modification enables the use of container sandboxing technologies, such as gVisor, to analyse potentially malicious packages without significantly compromising the host system.",2025-11-13 04:39:40+00:00,2025-11-13 04:39:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09957v1
Privacy-Preserving Explainable AIoT Application via SHAP Entropy Regularization,"The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.",2025-11-12 22:13:32+00:00,2025-11-12 22:13:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09775v1
Intelligent Carrier Allocation: A Cross-Modal Reasoning Framework for Adaptive Multimodal Steganography,"In today's digital world, which has many different types of media, steganography, the art of secret communication, has a lot of problems to deal with. Traditional methods are often fixed and only work with one type of carrier media. This means they don't work well with all the different types of media that are out there. This system doesn't send data to ""weak"" or easily detectable carriers because it can't adapt. This makes the system less safe and less secret in general. This paper proposes a novel Intelligent Carrier Allocation framework founded on a Cross-Modal Reasoning (CMR) Engine. This engine looks at a wide range of carriers, such as images, audio, and text, to see if they are good for steganography. It uses important measurements like entropy, signal complexity, and vocabulary richness to come up with a single reliability score for each modality. The framework uses these scores to fairly and intelligently share the secret bitstream, giving more data to carriers that are thought to be stronger and more complex. This adaptive allocation strategy makes the system as hard to find as possible and as strong as possible against steganalysis. We demonstrate that this reasoning-based approach is more secure and superior in data protection compared to static, non-adaptive multimodal techniques. This makes it possible to build stronger and smarter secret communication systems.",2025-11-12 18:55:59+00:00,2025-11-12 18:55:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09552v1
Slice-Aware Spoofing Detection in 5G Networks Using Lightweight Machine Learning,"The increasing virtualization of fifth generation (5G) networks expands the attack surface of the user plane, making spoofing a persistent threat to slice integrity and service reliability. This study presents a slice-aware lightweight machine-learning framework for detecting spoofing attacks within 5G network slices. The framework was implemented on a reproducible Open5GS and srsRAN testbed emulating three service classes such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) under controlled benign and adversarial traffic. Two efficient classifiers, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained independently for each slice using statistical flow features derived from mirrored user-plane traffic. Slice-aware training improved detection accuracy by up to 5% and achieved F1-scores between 0.93 and 0.96 while maintaining real-time operation on commodity edge hardware. The results demonstrate that aligning security intelligence with slice boundaries enhances detection reliability and preserves operational isolation, enabling practical deployment in 5G network-security environments. Conceptually, the work bridges network-security architecture and adaptive machine learning by showing that isolation-aware intelligence can achieve scalable, privacy-preserving spoofing defense without high computational cost.",2025-11-12 18:44:02+00:00,2025-11-12 18:44:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09610v1
Federated Learning for Pediatric Pneumonia Detection: Enabling Collaborative Diagnosis Without Sharing Patient Data,"Early and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (CXRs) is clinically critical to expedite treatment and isolation, reduce complications, and curb unnecessary antibiotic use. Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.   In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.",2025-11-12 18:17:06+00:00,2025-11-12 18:17:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11714v1
Enhancing Password Security Through a High-Accuracy Scoring Framework Using Random Forests,"Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.",2025-11-13 04:59:43+00:00,2025-11-12 17:05:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09492v2
An explainable Recursive Feature Elimination to detect Advanced Persistent Threats using Random Forest classifier,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in modern cybersecurity frameworks by providing a primary defense mechanism against sophisticated threat actors. In this paper, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that integrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest (RF) to enhance detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). By using CICIDS2017 dataset, the approach begins with comprehensive data preprocessing and narrows down the most significant features via RFE. A Random Forest (RF) model was trained on the refined feature set, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) used to interpret the contribution of each selected feature. Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers. The findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating explainable AI and feature selection to develop a robust, transparent, and deployable IDS solution.",2025-11-12 15:51:27+00:00,2025-11-12 15:51:27+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09603v1
AdaptDel: Adaptable Deletion Rate Randomized Smoothing for Certified Robustness,"We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.",2025-11-12 13:26:10+00:00,2025-11-12 13:26:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09316v1
SecTracer: A Framework for Uncovering the Root Causes of Network Intrusions via Security Provenance,"Modern enterprise networks comprise diverse and heterogeneous systems that support a wide range of services, making it challenging for administrators to track and analyze sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), which often exploit multiple vectors. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of network-level security provenance, which enables the systematic establishment of causal relationships across hosts at the network level, facilitating the accurate identification of the root causes of security incidents. Building on this concept, we present SecTracer as a framework for a network-wide provenance analysis. SecTracer offers three main contributions: (i) comprehensive and efficient forensic data collection in enterprise networks via software-defined networking (SDN), (ii) reconstruction of attack histories through provenance graphs to provide a clear and interpretable view of intrusions, and (iii) proactive attack prediction using probabilistic models. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of SecTracer through a real-world APT simulation, demonstrating its capability to enhance threat mitigation while introducing less than 1% network throughput overhead and negligible latency impact.",2025-11-12 12:25:36+00:00,2025-11-12 12:25:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09266v1
Slaying the Dragon: The Quest for Democracy in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs),"This chapter explores how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a novel institutional form based on blockchain technology, challenge traditional centralized governance structures. DAOs govern projects ranging from finance to science and digital communities. They aim to redistribute decision-making power through programmable, transparent, and participatory mechanisms. This chapter outlines both the opportunities DAOs present, such as incentive alignment, rapid coordination, and censorship resistance, and the challenges they face, including token concentration, low participation, and the risk of de facto centralization. It further discusses the emerging intersection of DAOs and artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for increased automation alongside the dangers of diminished human oversight and algorithmic opacity. Ultimately, we discuss under what circumstances DAOs can fulfill their democratic promise or risk replicating the very power asymmetries they seek to overcome.",2025-11-12 12:24:46+00:00,2025-11-12 12:24:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09263v1
Unveiling Hidden Threats: Using Fractal Triggers to Boost Stealthiness of Distributed Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning,"Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.",2025-11-12 12:15:54+00:00,2025-11-12 12:15:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09252v1
Value-Aligned Prompt Moderation via Zero-Shot Agentic Rewriting for Safe Image Generation,"Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.",2025-11-12 09:52:47+00:00,2025-11-12 09:52:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11693v1
"One Signature, Multiple Payments: Demystifying and Detecting Signature Replay Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts","Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.",2025-11-12 09:17:13+00:00,2025-11-12 09:17:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09134v1
Differentially Private Rankings via Outranking Methods and Performance Data Aggregation,"Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.",2025-11-12 08:50:50+00:00,2025-11-12 08:50:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09120v1
Towards a Generalisable Cyber Defence Agent for Real-World Computer Networks,"Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.",2025-11-12 08:38:34+00:00,2025-11-12 08:38:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09114v1
Improving Sustainability of Adversarial Examples in Class-Incremental Learning,"Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.",2025-11-12 08:01:16+00:00,2025-11-12 08:01:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09088v1
Attack-Centric by Design: A Program-Structure Taxonomy of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities,"Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.",2025-11-12 07:06:31+00:00,2025-11-12 07:06:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09051v1
MedHE: Communication-Efficient Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Adaptive Gradient Sparsification for Healthcare,"Healthcare federated learning requires strong privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency across resource-constrained medical institutions. This paper presents MedHE, a novel framework combining adaptive gradient sparsification with CKKS homomorphic encryption to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning on sensitive medical data. Our approach introduces a dynamic threshold mechanism with error compensation for top-k gradient selection, achieving 97.5 percent communication reduction while preserving model utility. We provide formal security analysis under Ring Learning with Errors assumptions and demonstrate differential privacy guarantees with epsilon less than or equal to 1.0. Statistical testing across 5 independent trials shows MedHE achieves 89.5 percent plus or minus 0.8 percent accuracy, maintaining comparable performance to standard federated learning (p=0.32) while reducing communication from 1277 MB to 32 MB per training round.

Robust Backdoor Removal by Reconstructing Trigger-Activated Changes in Latent Representation,"Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.",2025-11-12 03:44:36+00:00,2025-11-12 03:44:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08944v1
3D Guard-Layer: An Integrated Agentic AI Safety System for Edge Artificial Intelligence,"AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.",2025-11-11 23:55:09+00:00,2025-11-11 23:55:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08842v1
Automated Hardware Trojan Insertion in Industrial-Scale Designs,"Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.",2025-11-11 19:08:31+00:00,2025-11-11 19:08:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08703v1
FAIRPLAI: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Fair and Private Machine Learning,"As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

QLCoder: A Query Synthesizer For Static Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities,"Static analysis tools provide a powerful means to detect security vulnerabilities by specifying queries that encode vulnerable code patterns. However, writing such queries is challenging and requires diverse expertise in security and program analysis. To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine, directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries.",2025-11-12 03:21:49+00:00,2025-11-11 17:06:04+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08462v2
Why does weak-OOD help? A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs,"Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines.",2025-11-11 15:46:44+00:00,2025-11-11 15:46:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08367v1
Binary and Multiclass Cyberattack Classification on GeNIS Dataset,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a promising approach to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features.",2025-11-11 15:46:14+00:00,2025-11-11 15:46:14+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08660v1
Revisiting Network Traffic Analysis: Compatible network flows for ML models,"To ensure that Machine Learning (ML) models can perform a robust detection and classification of cyberattacks, it is essential to train them with high-quality datasets with relevant features. However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.",2025-11-11 15:23:56+00:00,2025-11-11 15:23:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08345v1
Publish Your Threat Models! The benefits far outweigh the dangers,"Threat modeling has long guided software development work, and we consider how Public Threat Models (PTM) can convey useful security information to others. We list some early adopter precedents, explain the many benefits, address potential objections, and cite regulatory drivers. Internal threat models may not be directly suitable for disclosure so we provide guidance for redaction and review, as well as when to update models (published or not). In a concluding call to action, we encourage the technology community to openly share their PTMs so the security properties of each component are known up and down the supply chain. Technology providers proud of their security efforts can show their work for competitive advantage, and customers can ask for and evaluate PTMs rather than be told ""it's secure"" but little more. Many great products already have fine threat models, and turning those into PTMs is a relatively minor task, so we argue this should (and easily could) become the new norm.",2025-11-11 14:29:09+00:00,2025-11-11 14:29:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08295v1
"SRE-Llama -- Fine-Tuned Meta's Llama LLM, Federated Learning, Blockchain and NFT Enabled Site Reliability Engineering(SRE) Platform for Communication and Networking Software Services","Software services are crucial for reliable communication and networking; therefore, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is important to ensure these systems stay reliable and perform well in cloud-native environments. SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core.",2025-11-11 14:09:44+00:00,2025-11-11 14:09:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08282v1
"""I need to learn better searching tactics for privacy policy laws.'' Investigating Software Developers' Behavior When Using Sources on Privacy Issues","Since the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), software developers increasingly have to make privacy-related decisions during system design and implementation. However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for more accessible, understandable, and actionable privacy resources for developers.",2025-11-11 09:58:06+00:00,2025-11-11 09:58:06+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08059v1
Class-feature Watermark: A Resilient Black-box Watermark Against Model Extraction Attacks,"Machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property, yet remain vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEA), where adversaries replicate their functionality through black-box queries. Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.   For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.",2025-11-16 08:56:18+00:00,2025-11-11 08:00:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07947v2
Blockchain-Integrated Privacy-Preserving Medical Insurance Claim Processing Using Homomorphic Encryption,"This research proposes a decentralized and cryptographically secure framework to address the most acute issues of privacy, data security, and protection in the ecosystem of medical insurance claim processing. The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems. As a result, these technologies are expected to foster the creation of a reliable, effective, and privacy safeguarding architecture that could transform the medical claim submission systems paradigm.",2025-11-11 04:22:36+00:00,2025-11-11 04:22:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07818v1
SALT: Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking in Chain of Thought,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.",2025-11-21 04:57:07+00:00,2025-11-11 02:45:48+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07772v2
JPRO: Automated Multimodal Jailbreaking via Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework,"The widespread application of large VLMs makes ensuring their secure deployment critical. While recent studies have demonstrated jailbreak attacks on VLMs, existing approaches are limited: they require either white-box access, restricting practicality, or rely on manually crafted patterns, leading to poor sample diversity and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose JPRO, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework designed for automated VLM jailbreaking. It effectively overcomes the shortcomings of prior methods in attack diversity and scalability. Through the coordinated action of four specialized agents and its two core modules: Tactic-Driven Seed Generation and Adaptive Optimization Loop, JPRO generates effective and diverse attack samples. Experimental results show that JPRO achieves over a 60\% attack success rate on multiple advanced VLMs, including GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing methods. As a black-box attack approach, JPRO not only uncovers critical security vulnerabilities in multimodal models but also offers valuable insights for evaluating and enhancing VLM robustness.",2025-11-10 17:16:46+00:00,2025-11-10 17:16:46+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07315v1
Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attacks on Generative Genomic Models,"The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.",2025-11-13 17:35:44+00:00,2025-11-10 17:09:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07503v2
Breaking the Stealth-Potency Trade-off in Clean-Image Backdoors with Generative Trigger Optimization,"Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.",2025-11-11 06:02:02+00:00,2025-11-10 15:37:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07210v2
On Stealing Graph Neural Network Models,"Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract a GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.",2025-11-13 16:16:36+00:00,2025-11-10 15:01:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07170v2
Improving Deepfake Detection with Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Data Augmentation,"The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.",2025-11-10 12:45:52+00:00,2025-11-10 12:45:52+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07051v1
3D-ANC: Adaptive Neural Collapse for Robust 3D Point Cloud Recognition,"Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.",2025-11-10 12:37:00+00:00,2025-11-10 12:37:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07040v1
HLPD: Aligning LLMs to Human Language Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection,"To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dfq2021/HLPD.",2025-11-12 16:32:00+00:00,2025-11-10 10:47:34+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06942v2
Generalized Security-Preserving Refinement for Concurrent Systems,"Ensuring compliance with Information Flow Security (IFS) is known to be challenging, especially for concurrent systems with large codebases such as multicore operating system (OS) kernels. Refinement, which verifies that an implementation preserves certain properties of a more abstract specification, is promising for tackling such challenges. However, in terms of refinement-based verification of security properties, existing techniques are still restricted to sequential systems or lack the expressiveness needed to capture complex security policies for concurrent systems.   In this work, we present a generalized security-preserving refinement technique, particularly for verifying the IFS of concurrent systems governed by potentially complex security policies. We formalize the IFS properties for concurrent systems and present a refinement-based compositional approach to prove that the generalized security properties (e.g., intransitive noninterference) are preserved between implementation and abstraction. The key intuition enabling such reasoning, compared to previous refinement work, is to establish a step-mapping relation between the implementation and the abstraction, which is sufficient to ensure that every paired step (in the abstraction and the implementation, respectively) is either permitted or prohibited by the security policy. We apply our approach to verify two non-trivial case studies against a collection of security policies. Our proofs are fully mechanized in Isabelle/HOL, during which we identified that two covert channels previously reported in the ARINC 653 single-core standard also exist in the ARINC 653 multicore standard. We subsequently proved the correctness of the revised mechanism, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.",2025-11-10 09:06:01+00:00,2025-11-10 09:06:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06862v1
Adversarial Node Placement in Decentralized Federated Learning: Maximum Spanning-Centrality Strategy and Performance Analysis,"As Federated Learning (FL) becomes more widespread, there is growing interest in its decentralized variants. Decentralized FL leverages the benefits of fast and energy-efficient device-to-device communications to obviate the need for a central server. However, this opens the door to new security vulnerabilities as well. While FL security has been a popular research topic, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized FL remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of various coordinated adversarial node placement strategies on decentralized FL's model training performance. We adapt two threads of placement strategies to this context: maximum span-based algorithms, and network centrality-based approaches. Building on them, we propose a novel attack strategy, MaxSpAN-FL, which is a hybrid between these paradigms that adjusts node placement probabilistically based on network topology characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our attack consistently induces the largest degradation in decentralized FL models compared with baseline schemes across various network configurations and numbers of coordinating adversaries. We also provide theoretical support for why eigenvector centrality-based attacks are suboptimal in decentralized FL. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of decentralized FL systems, setting the stage for future research aimed at developing more secure and robust decentralized FL frameworks.",2025-11-10 06:09:28+00:00,2025-11-10 06:09:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06742v1
How do data owners say no? A case study of data consent mechanisms in web-scraped vision-language AI training datasets,"The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.",2025-11-23 03:20:17+00:00,2025-11-10 05:41:02+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08637v2
PhaseSeed: Precise Call Graph Construction for Split-Phase Applications using Dynamic Seeding,"Precise and sound call graph construction is crucial for many software security mechanisms. Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering. PhaseSeed provides up to 92.6% precision improvement for CFI compared to static call graph construction techniques, and filters nine additional security-critical system calls when used to generate Seccomp profiles.",2025-11-10 03:17:09+00:00,2025-11-10 03:17:09+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06661v1
SteganoSNN: SNN-Based Audio-in-Image Steganography with Encryption,"Secure data hiding remains a fundamental challenge in digital communication, requiring a careful balance between computational efficiency and perceptual transparency. The balance between security and performance is increasingly fragile with the emergence of generative AI systems capable of autonomously generating and optimising sophisticated cryptanalysis and steganalysis algorithms, thereby accelerating the exposure of vulnerabilities in conventional data-hiding schemes.   This work introduces SteganoSNN, a neuromorphic steganographic framework that exploits spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve secure, low-power, and high-capacity multimedia data hiding. Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness. SteganoSNN establishes a foundation for neuromorphic steganography, enabling secure, energy-efficient communication for Edge-AI, IoT, and biomedical applications.",2025-11-09 23:31:53+00:00,2025-11-09 23:31:53+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06573v1
KG-DF: A Black-box Defense Framework against Jailbreak Attacks Based on Knowledge Graphs,"With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in various fields, the security challenges they face have become increasingly prominent, especially the issue of jailbreak. These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.",2025-11-09 14:39:40+00:00,2025-11-09 14:39:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07480v1
Efficient LLM Safety Evaluation through Multi-Agent Debate,"Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Enhancing Deep Learning-Based Rotational-XOR Attacks on Lightweight Block Ciphers Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64,"At CRYPTO 2019, Gohr pioneered neural cryptanalysis by introducing differential-based neural distinguishers to attack Speck32/64, establishing a novel paradigm combining deep learning with differential cryptanalysis.Since then, constructing neural distinguishers has become a significant approach to achieving the deep learning-based cryptanalysis for block ciphers.This paper advances rotational-XOR (RX) attacks through neural networks, focusing on optimizing distinguishers and presenting key-recovery attacks for the lightweight block ciphers Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64.In particular, we first construct the fundamental data formats specially designed for training RX-neural distinguishers by refining the existing data formats for differential-neural distinguishers. Based on these data formats, we systematically identify optimal RX-differences with Hamming weights 1 and 2 that develop high-accuracy RX-neural distinguishers. Then, through innovative application of the bit sensitivity test, we achieve significant compression of data format without sacrificing the distinguisher accuracy. This optimization enables us to add more multi-ciphertext pairs into the data formats, further strengthening the performance of RX-neural distinguishers. As an application, we obtain 14- and 17-round RX-neural distinguishers for Simon32/64 and Simeck32/64, which improves the previous ones by 3 and 2 rounds, respectively.In addition, we propose two novel techniques, key bit sensitivity test and the joint wrong key response, to tackle the challenge of applying Bayesian's key-recovery strategy to the target cipher that adopts nonlinear key schedule in the related-key setting without considering of weak-key space. By this, we can straightforwardly mount a 17-round key-recovery attack on Simeck32/64 based on the improved 16-round RX-nerual distinguisher. To the best of our knowledge, the presented RX-neural......",2025-11-09 11:35:11+00:00,2025-11-09 11:35:11+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06336v1
Setting $\varepsilon$ is not the Issue in Differential Privacy,"This position paper argues that setting the privacy budget in differential privacy should not be viewed as an important limitation of differential privacy compared to alternative methods for privacy-preserving machine learning. The so-called problem of interpreting the privacy budget is often presented as a major hindrance to the wider adoption of differential privacy in real-world deployments and is sometimes used to promote alternative mitigation techniques for data protection. We believe this misleads decision-makers into choosing unsafe methods. We argue that the difficulty in interpreting privacy budgets does not stem from the definition of differential privacy itself, but from the intrinsic difficulty of estimating privacy risks in context, a challenge that any rigorous method for privacy risk assessment face. Moreover, we claim that any sound method for estimating privacy risks should, given the current state of research, be expressible within the differential privacy framework or justify why it cannot.",2025-11-09 10:03:45+00:00,2025-11-09 10:03:45+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06305v1
HYDRA: A Hybrid Heuristic-Guided Deep Representation Architecture for Predicting Latent Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Patched Functions,"Software security testing, particularly when enhanced with deep learning models, has become a powerful approach for improving software quality, enabling faster detection of known flaws in source code. However, many approaches miss post-fix latent vulnerabilities that remain even after patches typically due to incomplete fixes or overlooked issues may later lead to zero-day exploits. In this paper, we propose $HYDRA$, a $Hy$brid heuristic-guided $D$eep $R$epresentation $A$rchitecture for predicting latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched functions that combines rule-based heuristics with deep representation learning to detect latent risky code patterns that may persist after patches. It integrates static vulnerability rules, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to uncover anomalies often missed by symbolic or neural models alone. We evaluate HYDRA in an unsupervised setting on patched functions from three diverse real-world software projects: Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick. Our results show HYDRA predicts 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions from Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick respectively as containing latent risks, including both heuristic matches and cases without heuristic matches ($None$) that may lead to zero-day vulnerabilities. It outperforms baseline models that rely solely on regex-derived features or their combination with embeddings, uncovering truly risky code variants that largely align with known heuristic patterns. These results demonstrate HYDRA's capability to surface hidden, previously undetected risks, advancing software security validation and supporting proactive zero-day vulnerabilities discovery.",2025-11-09 04:35:36+00:00,2025-11-09 04:35:36+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06220v1
RAG-targeted Adversarial Attack on LLM-based Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework,"The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping communication and operational practices across industries, but it also broadens the attack surface and increases susceptibility to security breaches. Artificial Intelligence has become a valuable solution in securing IoT networks, with Large Language Models (LLMs) enabling automated attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Despite advancements, the use of LLMs in such systems further expands the attack surface, putting entire networks at risk by introducing vulnerabilities such as prompt injection and data poisoning. In this work, we attack an LLM-based IoT attack analysis and mitigation framework to test its adversarial robustness. We construct an attack description dataset and use it in a targeted data poisoning attack that applies word-level, meaning-preserving perturbations to corrupt the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base of the framework. We then compare pre-attack and post-attack mitigation responses from the target model, ChatGPT-5 Thinking, to measure the impact of the attack on model performance, using an established evaluation rubric designed for human experts and judge LLMs. Our results show that small perturbations degrade LLM performance by weakening the linkage between observed network traffic features and attack behavior, and by reducing the specificity and practicality of recommended mitigations for resource-constrained devices.",2025-11-09 03:50:17+00:00,2025-11-09 03:50:17+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06212v1
Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting,"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.",2025-11-09 02:56:54+00:00,2025-11-09 02:56:54+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06197v1

CatBack: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Tabular Data via Categorical Encoding,"Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.   We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.",2025-11-08 17:02:42+00:00,2025-11-08 17:02:42+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06072v1
Cryptographic Binding Should Not Be Optional: A Formal-Methods Analysis of FIDO UAF Channel Binding,"As a case study in cryptographic binding, we present a formal-methods analysis of the cryptographic channel binding mechanisms in the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) authentication protocol, which seeks to reduce the use of traditional passwords in favor of authentication devices. First, we show that UAF's channel bindings fail to mitigate protocol interaction by a Dolev-Yao adversary, enabling the adversary to transfer the server's authentication challenge to alternate sessions of the protocol. As a result, in some contexts, the adversary can masquerade as a client and establish an authenticated session with a server (e.g., possibly a bank server). Second, we implement a proof-of-concept man-in-the-middle attack against eBay's open source FIDO UAF implementation. Third, we propose and formally verify improvements to UAF. The weakness we analyze is similar to the vulnerability discovered in the Needham-Schroeder protocol over 25 years ago. That this vulnerability appears in the FIDO UAF standard highlights the strong need for protocol designers to bind messages properly and to analyze their designs with formal-methods tools. To our knowledge, we are first to carry out a formal-methods analysis of channel binding in UAF and first to exhibit details of an attack on UAF that exploits the weaknesses of UAF's channel binding. Our case study illustrates the importance of cryptographically binding context to protocol messages to prevent an adversary from misusing messages out of context.",2025-11-08 14:50:52+00:00,2025-11-08 14:50:52+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06028v1
Injecting Falsehoods: Adversarial Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Undermining Factual Recall in LLMs,"LLMs are now an integral part of information retrieval. As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to ""victim"" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.",2025-11-20 10:04:04+00:00,2025-11-08 08:30:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05919v2
MCP-RiskCue: Can LLM Infer Risk Information From MCP Server System Logs?,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in solving complex tasks when integrated with external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models,"Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.",2025-11-25 17:27:33+00:00,2025-11-08 05:38:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865v2
Securing UAV Communications by Fusing Cross-Layer Fingerprints,"The open nature of wireless communications renders unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications vulnerable to impersonation attacks, under which malicious UAVs can impersonate authorized ones with stolen digital certificates. Traditional fingerprint-based UAV authentication approaches rely on a single modality of sensory data gathered from a single layer of the network model, resulting in unreliable authentication experiences, particularly when UAVs are mobile and in an open-world environment. To transcend these limitations, this paper proposes SecureLink, a UAV authentication system that is among the first to employ cross-layer information for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of UAV authentication. Instead of using single modalities, SecureLink fuses physical-layer radio frequency (RF) fingerprints and application-layer micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fingerprints into reliable UAV identifiers via multimodal fusion. SecureLink first aligns fingerprints from channel state information measurements and telemetry data, such as feedback readings of onboard accelerometers, gyroscopes, and barometers. Then, an attention-based neural network is devised for in-depth feature fusion. Next, the fused features are trained by a multi-similarity loss and fed into a one-class support vector machine for open-world authentication. We extensively implement our SecureLink using three different types of UAVs and evaluate it in different environments. With only six additional data frames, SecureLink achieves a closed-world accuracy of 98.61% and an open-world accuracy of 97.54% with two impersonating UAVs, outperforming the existing approaches in authentication robustness and communication overheads. Finally, our datasets collected from these experiments are available on GitHub: https://github.com/PhyGroup/SecureLink\_data.",2025-11-08 02:00:31+00:00,2025-11-08 02:00:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05796v1
Preserving security in a world with powerful AI Considerations for the future Defense Architecture,"Advances in AI threaten to invalidate assumptions underpinning today's defense architecture.

BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services,"With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.",2025-11-07 12:25:39+00:00,2025-11-07 12:25:39+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1
A Secured Intent-Based Networking (sIBN) with Data-Driven Time-Aware Intrusion Detection,"While Intent-Based Networking (IBN) promises operational efficiency through autonomous and abstraction-driven network management, a critical unaddressed issue lies in IBN's implicit trust in the integrity of intent ingested by the network. This inherent assumption of data reliability creates a blind spot exploitable by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an adversary intercepts and alters intent before it is enacted, compelling the network to orchestrate malicious configurations. This study proposes a secured IBN (sIBN) system with data driven intrusion detection method designed to secure legitimate user intent from adversarial tampering. The proposed intent intrusion detection system uses a ML model applied for network behavioral anomaly detection to reveal temporal patterns of intent tampering. This is achieved by leveraging a set of original behavioral metrics and newly engineered time-aware features, with the model's hyperparameters fine-tuned through the randomized search cross-validation (RSCV) technique. Numerical results based on real-world data sets, show the effectiveness of sIBN, achieving the best performance across standard evaluation metrics, in both binary and multi classification tasks, while maintaining low error rates.",2025-11-07 10:28:01+00:00,2025-11-07 10:28:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05133v1
Cybersecurity AI in OT: Insights from an AI Top-10 Ranker in the Dragos OT CTF 2025,"Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity increasingly relies on rapid response across malware analysis, network forensics, and reverse engineering disciplines.

Using CAI telemetry and official leaderboard data, we quantify CAI's trajectory relative to the leading human-operated teams. CAI reached Rank~1 between competition hours 7.0 and 8.0, crossed 10,000 points at 5.42~hours (1,846~pts/h), and completed 32 of the competition's 34 challenges before automated operations were paused at hour~24 with a final score of 18,900 points (6th place). The top-3 human teams solved 33 of 34 challenges, collectively leaving only the 600-point ``Kiddy Tags -- 1'' unsolved; they were also the only teams to clear the 1,000-point ``Moot Force'' binary. The top-5 human teams averaged 1,347~pts/h to the same milestone, marking a 37\% velocity advantage for CAI. We analyse time-resolved scoring, category coverage, and solve cadence.

Zero Trust Security Model Implementation in Microservices Architectures Using Identity Federation,"The microservice bombshells that have been linked with the microservice expansion have altered the application architectures, offered agility and scalability in terms of complexity in security trade-offs. Feeble legacy-based perimeter-based policies are unable to offer safeguard to distributed workloads and temporary interaction among and in between the services. The article itself is a case on the need of the Zero Trust Security Model of micro services ecosystem, particularly, the fact that human and workloads require identity federation. It is proposed that the solution framework will be based on industry-standard authentication and authorization and end-to-end trust identity technologies, including Authorization and OpenID connect (OIDC), Authorization and OAuth 2.0 token exchange, and Authorization and SPIFFE/ SPIRE workload identities. Experimental evaluation is a unique demonstration of a superior security position of making use of a smaller attack surface, harmony policy enforcement, as well as interoperability across multi- domain environments. The research results overlay that the federated identity combined with the Zero Trust basics not only guarantee the rules relating to authentication and authorization but also fully complies with the latest DevSecOps standards of microservice deployment, which is automated, scaled, and resilient.

Bit-Flipping Attack Exploration and Countermeasure in 5G Network,"5G communication technology has become a vital component in a wide range of applications due to its unique advantages such as high data rate and low latency. While much of the existing research has focused on optimizing its efficiency and performance, security considerations have not received comparable attention, potentially leaving critical vulnerabilities unexplored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of 5G systems to bit-flipping attacks, which is an integrity attack where an adversary intercepts 5G network traffic and modifies specific fields of an encrypted message without decryption, thus mutating the message while remaining valid to the receiver. Notably, these attacks do not require the attacker to know the plaintext, and only the semantic meaning or position of certain fields would be enough to effect targeted modifications. We conduct our analysis on OpenAirInterface (OAI), an open-source 5G platform that follows the 3GPP Technical Specifications, to rigorously test the real-world feasibility and impact of bit-flipping attacks under current 5G encryption mechanisms. Finally, we propose a keystream-based shuffling defense mechanism to mitigate the effect of such attacks by raising the difficulty of manipulating specific encrypted fields, while introducing no additional communication overhead compared to the NAS Integrity Algorithm (NIA) in 5G. Our findings reveal that enhancements to 5G security are needed to better protect against attacks that alter data during transmission at the network level.",2025-11-06 23:51:28+00:00,2025-11-06 23:51:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04882v1

Security Evaluation of Quantum Circuit Split Compilation under an Oracle-Guided Attack,"Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are systematically tested against input-output observations, with iteratively pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new protection schemes.",2025-11-06 22:06:51+00:00,2025-11-06 22:06:51+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04842v1
Trustworthiness Calibration Framework for Phishing Email Detection Using Large Language Models,"Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification, their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario, using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in LLM-based phishing detection.",2025-11-06 18:14:44+00:00,2025-11-06 18:14:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04728v1
Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments,"The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility.

TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.",2025-11-06 17:03:33+00:00,2025-11-06 17:03:33+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550v1
Large Language Models for Cyber Security,"This paper studies the integration off Large Language Models into cybersecurity tools and protocols. The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.",2025-11-06 16:25:35+00:00,2025-11-06 16:25:35+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04508v1
Adversarially Robust and Interpretable Magecart Malware Detection,"Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied, further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to distinguish between benign and malicious scripts. Such models are supported by a Behavior Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) which captures structural behavior patterns in scripts, helping to analyze and classify client-side script execution logs. To ensure robustness against adversarial evasion attacks, the ML models were adversarially trained and evaluated using attacks from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox and the Adaptative Perturbation Pattern Method. In addition, concise explanations of ML model decisions are provided, supporting transparency and user trust. Experimental validation demonstrated high detection performance and interpretable reasoning, demonstrating that traditional ML models can be effective in real-world web security contexts.",2025-11-06 15:13:29+00:00,2025-11-06 15:13:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04440v1
A Parallel Region-Adaptive Differential Privacy Framework for Image Pixelization,"The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability, and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity, leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring, driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.",2025-11-06 10:51:20+00:00,2025-11-06 10:51:20+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04261v1
Black-Box Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.",2025-11-06 09:24:49+00:00,2025-11-06 09:24:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04215v1
OTS-PC: OTS-based Payment Channels for the Lightning Network,"We present a new type of bidirectional payment channel based on One-Time Signatures on state sequence numbers.

Design and Detection of Covert Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks on Water Treatment Plants,"Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness, underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial control environments.",2025-11-06 01:49:38+00:00,2025-11-06 01:49:38+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03971v1
Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion,"Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code, but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

Security Analysis of Agentic AI Communication Protocols: A Comparative Evaluation,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly foundational to complex, distributed workflows. Yet, the security of their underlying communication protocols remains critically under-examined. This paper presents the first empirical, comparative security analysis of the official CORAL implementation and a high-fidelity, SDK-based ACP implementation, benchmarked against a literature-based evaluation of A2A. Using a 14 point vulnerability taxonomy, we systematically assess their defenses across authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Our results reveal a pronounced security dichotomy: CORAL exhibits a robust architectural design, particularly in its transport-layer message validation and session isolation, but suffers from critical implementation-level vulnerabilities, including authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway. Conversely, ACP's architectural flexibility, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into high-impact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these findings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing protocols remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines CORAL's integrated architecture with ACP's mandatory per-message integrity guarantees, laying the groundwork for resilient, next-generation agent communications.",2025-11-05 20:19:22+00:00,2025-11-05 20:19:22+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03841v1
Temporal Analysis Framework for Intrusion Detection Systems: A Novel Taxonomy for Time-Aware Cybersecurity,"Most intrusion detection systems still identify attacks only after significant damage has occurred, detecting late-stage tactics rather than early indicators of compromise. This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework and taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic review of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS methods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to multi-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow sequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal coverage across MITRE ATT&CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance through Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely used datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress toward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for developing IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber threats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms.",2025-11-05 19:03:40+00:00,2025-11-05 19:03:40+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03799v1
Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like ""money laundering"" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.",2025-11-05 17:47:46+00:00,2025-11-05 17:47:46+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675v1
Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles,"The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the information coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times, philosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure the reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which pertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic machines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles and the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this problem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles has added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains. This paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles, developing a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy, lexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the relationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented framework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and computational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each field. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing strategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights from Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can also be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",2025-11-05 09:32:01+00:00,2025-11-05 09:32:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03319v1
Let the Bees Find the Weak Spots: A Path Planning Perspective on Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks against LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.",2025-11-05 08:05:58+00:00,2025-11-05 08:05:58+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03271v1
Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic,"Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.",2025-11-05 06:36:16+00:00,2025-11-05 06:36:16+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1
Jailbreaking in the Haystack,"Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.",2025-11-05 01:12:50+00:00,2025-11-05 01:12:50+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04707v1
Exploratory Analysis of Cyberattack Patterns on E-Commerce Platforms Using Statistical Methods,"Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms have grown in sophistication, threatening consumer trust and operational continuity. This research presents a hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247). The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type classification. Ethical considerations, including responsible use of sensitive data and bias assessment, were incorporated. Despite class imbalance and reliance on historical data, the study provides insights for proactive cybersecurity resource allocation and outlines directions for future real-time threat detection research.",2025-11-04 21:38:59+00:00,2025-11-04 21:38:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03020v1
PrivyWave: Privacy-Aware Wireless Sensing of Heartbeat,"Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar, unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations (120° field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in pervasive health monitoring.",2025-11-06 02:34:25+00:00,2025-11-04 20:54:59+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02993v2
Lightweight Session-Key Rekeying Framework for Secure IoT-Edge Communication,"The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands security mechanisms that protect constrained devices without the computational cost of public-key cryptography. Conventional Pre-Shared Key (PSK) encryption, while efficient, remains vulnerable due to static key reuse, replay attacks, and the lack of forward secrecy. This paper presents the Dynamic Session Enhanced Key Protocol (DSEKP) - a lightweight session-key rekeying framework, a fully symmetric extension to PSK that derives per-session AES-GCM keys using the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF-SHA256) and authenticates session establishment through an HMAC proof in a single init-ack exchange. DSEKP was implemented on an ESP32 IoT sensor node and a Raspberry Pi 5 edge server communicating through a Mosquitto MQTT broker, and benchmarked against a static PSK baseline over more than 6,500 encrypted packets per configuration. The results demonstrate nearly identical throughput and reliability, with moderate overhead - mean latency increased by 27% and payload size by 10% - while delivering per-session forward secrecy and built-in replay protection. These findings confirm that dynamic symmetric rekeying can substantially strengthen IoT-Edge links with minimal computational and bandwidth cost, offering a practical migration path from static PSK to session-aware, scalable, and reproducible IoT security.",2025-11-04 19:12:18+00:00,2025-11-04 19:12:18+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02924v1
PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.",2025-11-06 12:47:29+00:00,2025-11-04 18:03:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v2
Adaptive and Robust Data Poisoning Detection and Sanitization in Wearable IoT Systems using Large Language Models,"The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting, whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives. These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable IoT systems.",2025-11-21 15:30:31+00:00,2025-11-04 15:59:10+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02894v3
Verifying LLM Inference to Prevent Model Weight Exfiltration,"As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and, more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.",2025-11-04 14:51:44+00:00,2025-11-04 14:51:44+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02620v1
AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.",2025-11-09 05:14:14+00:00,2025-11-04 08:56:28+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376v2

Extending MapReduce to decentralized settings, PMSR enables computation to move to the data, ensuring verifiable privacy, efficient price discovery, and incentive alignment. Demonstrations include large-scale recommender audits, privacy-preserving LLM ensembling (87.5\% MMLU accuracy across six models), and distributed analytics over hundreds of nodes.

Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Rare Event Prediction,"Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2) quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical methods.",2025-11-03 20:24:55+00:00,2025-11-03 20:24:55+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02042v1
Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons(PoSN): Neuromorphic Consensus for Next-Generation Blockchains,"Blockchain systems face persistent challenges of scalability, latency, and energy inefficiency. Existing consensus protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) either consume excessive resources or risk centralization. This paper proposes \textit{Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons (PoSN)}, a neuromorphic consensus protocol inspired by spiking neural networks. PoSN encodes transactions as spike trains, elects leaders through competitive firing dynamics, and finalizes blocks via neural synchronization, enabling parallel and event-driven consensus with minimal energy overhead. A hybrid system architecture is implemented on neuromorphic platforms, supported by simulation frameworks such as Nengo and PyNN. Experimental results show significant gains in energy efficiency, throughput, and convergence compared to PoB and PoR. PoSN establishes a foundation for sustainable, adaptive blockchains suitable for IoT, edge, and large-scale distributed systems.",2025-11-03 19:31:47+00:00,2025-11-03 19:31:47+00:00,CC0 1.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02868v1
AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents,"AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.   AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy formalization: a novel cross-LLM voting mechanism to guarantee confidence of the parsed privacy policy model. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates data practices based on the AI agent's context and the privacy policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology graphs and automata-based checking connect the privacy policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checking. (iv) User interface: an infrastructure-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy policy violations, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.   We evaluate AudAgent with AI agents built using mainstream frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and visualizing privacy policy violations in real time. Using AudAgent, we also find that most privacy policies omit explicit safeguards for highly sensitive data such as SSNs, whose misuse violates legal requirements, and that many agents do not refuse handling such data via third-party tools, including those controlled by Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AudAgent proactively blocks operations on such data, overriding the agents' original privacy policy and behavior.",2025-11-20 21:03:58+00:00,2025-11-03 17:32:08+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07441v2

We prove soundness and completeness of access Hoare logic, and provide a link between access Hoare logic and standard Hoare logic.",2025-11-05 22:48:05+00:00,2025-11-03 17:04:49+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01754v2
Prompt Injection as an Emerging Threat: Evaluating the Resilience of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in intelligent systems that perform reasoning, summarization, and code generation. Their ability to follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4 %), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and reliability.",2025-11-11 21:55:25+00:00,2025-11-03 14:43:56+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01634v2
Evaluation of compliance with democratic and technical standards of i-voting in elections to academic senates in Czech higher education,"The shift towards increased remote work and digital communication, driven by recent global developments, has led to the widespread adoption of i-voting systems, including in academic institutions. This paper critically evaluates the use of i-voting platforms for elections to academic senates at Czech public universities, focusing on the democratic and technical challenges they present. A total of 18 out of 26 Czech public universities have implemented remote electronic voting for these elections. Yet, the systems often lack the necessary transparency, raising significant concerns regarding their adherence to democratic norms, such as election security, voter privacy, and the integrity of the process. Through interviews with system developers and administrators, along with a survey of potential voters, the study underscores the critical need for transparency. Without it, a comprehensive assessment of the technical standards and the overall legitimacy of the i-voting systems remains unattainable, potentially undermining the credibility of the electoral outcomes.",2025-11-03 14:00:47+00:00,2025-11-03 14:00:47+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01598v1
Federated Cyber Defense: Privacy-Preserving Ransomware Detection Across Distributed Systems,"Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing, and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI) detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing. Compounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that are both robust and adaptable.   In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a ransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This paradigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both software and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall systems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be transferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or regulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we validate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP) dataset.   Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by a relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to centralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable, high-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware detection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.",2025-11-03 13:54:13+00:00,2025-11-03 13:54:13+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01583v1
Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for LVLMs via Prior Knowledge-Calibrated Memory Probing,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on vast corpora of visual and textual data. Empowered by large-scale parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/spmede/KCMP.",2025-11-03 13:16:30+00:00,2025-11-03 13:16:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01952v1
"Security-Aware Joint Sensing, Communication, and Computing Optimization in Low Altitude Wireless Networks","As terrestrial resources become increasingly saturated, the research attention is shifting to the low-altitude airspace, with many emerging applications such as urban air taxis and aerial inspection. Low-Altitude Wireless Networks (LAWNs) are the foundation for these applications, with integrated sensing, communications, and computing (ISCC) being one of the core parts of LAWNs. However, the openness of low-altitude airspace exposes communications to security threats, degrading ISCC performance and ultimately compromising the reliability of applications supported by LAWNs. To address these challenges, this paper studies joint performance optimization of ISCC while considering secrecyness of the communications. Specifically, we derive beampattern error, secrecy rate, and age of information (AoI) as performance metrics for sensing, secrecy communication, and computing. Building on these metrics, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances sensing and computation performance while keeping the probability of communication being detected below a required threshold. We then propose a deep Q-network (DQN)-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which adaptively selects evolutionary operators according to the evolving optimization objectives, thereby leading to more effective solutions. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method achieves a superior balance among sensing accuracy, communication secrecyness, and information freshness compared with baseline algorithms, thereby safeguarding ISCC performance and LAWN-supported low-altitude applications.",2025-11-03 11:06:41+00:00,2025-11-03 11:06:41+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01451v1
Beyond Static Thresholds: Adaptive RRC Signaling Storm Detection with Extreme Value Theory,"In 5G and beyond networks, the radio communication between a User Equipment (UE) and a base station (gNodeB or gNB), also known as the air interface, is a critical component of network access and connectivity. During the connection establishment procedure, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer can be vulnerable to signaling storms, which threaten the availability of the radio access control plane. These attacks may occur when one or more UEs send a large number of connection requests to the gNB, preventing new UEs from establishing connections. In this paper, we investigate the detection of such threats and propose an adaptive threshold-based detection system based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The proposed solution is evaluated numerically by applying simulated attack scenarios based on a realistic threat model on top of real-world RRC traffic data from an operator network. We show that, by leveraging features from the RRC layer only, the detection system can not only identify the attacks but also differentiate them from legitimate high-traffic situations. The adaptive threshold calculated using EVT ensures that the system can work under diverse traffic conditions. The results show high accuracy, precision, and recall values (above 93%), and a low detection latency even under complex conditions.",2025-11-03 09:42:12+00:00,2025-11-03 09:42:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01391v1
Black-Box Differentially Private Nonparametric Confidence Intervals Under Minimal Assumptions,"We introduce a simple, general framework that takes any differentially private estimator of any arbitrary quantity as a black box, and from it constructs a differentially private nonparametric confidence interval of that quantity. Our approach repeatedly subsamples the data, applies the private estimator to each subsample, and then post-processes the resulting empirical CDF to a confidence interval. Our analysis uses the randomness from the subsampling to achieve privacy amplification. Under mild assumptions, the empirical CDF we obtain approaches the CDF of the private statistic as the sample size grows. We use this to show that the confidence intervals we estimate are asymptotically valid, tight, and equivalent to their non-private counterparts. We provide empirical evidence that our method performs well compared with the (less-general) state-of-the-art algorithms.",2025-11-03 07:38:30+00:00,2025-11-03 07:38:30+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01303v1
Verification and Attack Synthesis for Network Protocols,"Network protocols are programs with inputs and outputs that follow predefined communication patterns to synchronize and exchange information. There are many protocols and each serves a different purpose, e.g., routing, transport, secure communication, etc. The functional and performance requirements for a protocol can be expressed using a formal specification, such as, a set of logical predicates over its traces. A protocol could be prevented from achieving its requirements due to a bug in its design or implementation, a component failure (e.g., a crash), or an attack. This dissertation shows that formal methods can feasibly characterize the functionality and performance of network protocols under normal conditions as well as when subjected to attacks.",2025-11-03 00:26:12+00:00,2025-11-03 00:26:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01124v1
Leakage-abuse Attack Against Substring-SSE with Partially Known Dataset,"Substring-searchable symmetric encryption (substring-SSE) has become increasingly critical for privacy-preserving applications in cloud systems. However, existing schemes remain vulnerable to information leakage during search operations, particularly when adversaries possess partial knowledge of the target dataset. Although leakage-abuse attacks have been widely studied for traditional SSE, their applicability to substring-SSE under partially known data assumptions remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first leakage-abuse attack on substring-SSE under partially-known dataset conditions. We develop a novel matrix-based correlation technique that extends and optimizes the LEAP framework for substring-SSE, enabling efficient recovery of plaintext data from encrypted suffix tree structures. Unlike existing approaches that rely on independent auxiliary datasets, our method directly exploits known data fragments to establish high-confidence mappings between ciphertext tokens and plaintext substrings through iterative matrix transformations. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, with recovery rates reaching 98.32% for substrings given 50% auxiliary knowledge. Even with only 10% prior knowledge, the attack achieves 74.42% substring recovery while maintaining strong scalability across datasets of varying sizes. The result reveals significant privacy risks in current substring-SSE designs and highlights the urgent need for leakage-resilient constructions.",2025-11-02 13:12:19+00:00,2025-11-02 13:12:19+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00930v1

Given its increasing threat, the insights guide future research and practical use of ML to combat Android malware.",2025-11-02 11:26:31+00:00,2025-11-02 11:26:31+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00894v1
EP-HDC: Hyperdimensional Computing with Encrypted Parameters for High-Throughput Privacy-Preserving Inference,"While homomorphic encryption (HE) provides strong privacy protection, its high computational cost has restricted its application to simple tasks. Recently, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) applied to HE has shown promising performance for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). However, when applied to more realistic scenarios such as batch inference, the HDC-based HE has still very high compute time as well as high encryption and data transmission overheads. To address this problem, we propose HDC with encrypted parameters (EP-HDC), which is a novel PPML approach featuring client-side HE, i.e., inference is performed on a client using a homomorphically encrypted model. Our EP-HDC can effectively mitigate the encryption and data transmission overhead, as well as providing high scalability with many clients while providing strong protection for user data and model parameters. In addition to application examples for our client-side PPML, we also present design space exploration involving quantization, architecture, and HE-related parameters. Our experimental results using the BFV scheme and the Face/Emotion datasets demonstrate that our method can improve throughput and latency of batch inference by orders of magnitude over previous PPML methods (36.52~1068x and 6.45~733x, respectively) with less than 1% accuracy degradation.",2025-11-01 23:22:01+00:00,2025-11-01 23:22:01+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00737v1
An Efficient Anomaly Detection Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Markov Process,"Wireless Sensor Networks forms the backbone of modern cyber physical systems used in various applications such as environmental monitoring, healthcare monitoring, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure. Ensuring the reliability of data collected through these networks is essential as these data may contain anomalies due to many reasons such as sensor faults, environmental disturbances, or malicious intrusions. In this paper a lightweight and interpretable anomaly detection framework based on a first order Markov chain model has been proposed. The method discretizes continuous sensor readings into finite states and models the temporal dynamics of sensor transitions through a transition probability matrix. Anomalies are detected when observed transitions occur with probabilities below a computed threshold, allowing for real time detection without labeled data or intensive computation. The proposed framework was validated using the Intel Berkeley Research Lab dataset, as a case study on indoor environmental monitoring demonstrates its capability to identify thermal spikes, voltage related faults, and irregular temperature fluctuations with high precision. Comparative analysis with Z score, Hidden Markov Model, and Auto encoder based methods shows that the proposed Markov based framework achieves a balanced trade-off between accuracy, F1 score is 0.86, interoperability, and computational efficiency. The systems scalability and low resource footprint highlight its suitability for large-scale and real time anomaly detection in WSN deployments.",2025-11-01 10:19:00+00:00,2025-11-01 10:19:00+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00481v1
Proactive DDoS Detection and Mitigation in Decentralized Software-Defined Networking via Port-Level Monitoring and Zero-Training Large Language Models,"Centralized Software-Defined Networking (cSDN) offers flexible and programmable control of networks but suffers from scalability and reliability issues due to its reliance on centralized controllers. Decentralized SDN (dSDN) alleviates these concerns by distributing control across multiple local controllers, yet this architecture remains highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and mitigation framework tailored for dSDN environments. The framework leverages lightweight port-level statistics combined with prompt engineering and in-context learning, enabling the DeepSeek-v3 Large Language Model (LLM) to classify traffic as benign or malicious without requiring fine-tuning or retraining. Once an anomaly is detected, mitigation is enforced directly at the attacker's port, ensuring that malicious traffic is blocked at their origin while normal traffic remains unaffected. An automatic recovery mechanism restores normal operation after the attack inactivity, ensuring both security and availability. Experimental evaluation under diverse DDoS attack scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves near-perfect detection, with 99.99% accuracy, 99.97% precision, 100% recall, 99.98% F1-score, and an AUC of 1.0. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining distributed monitoring with zero-training LLM inference, providing a proactive and scalable defense mechanism for securing dSDN infrastructures against DDoS threats.",2025-11-01 08:57:29+00:00,2025-11-01 08:57:29+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00460v1
ToxicTextCLIP: Text-Based Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on CLIP Pre-training,"The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

Zero-Knowledge Extensions on Solana: A Theory of ZK Architecture,"This paper reconstructs zero-knowledge extensions on Solana as an architecture theory. Drawing on the existing ecosystem and on the author's prior papers and implementations as reference material, we propose a two-axis model that normalizes zero-knowledge (ZK) use by purpose (scalability vs. privacy) and by placement (on-chain vs. off-chain). On this grid we define five layer-crossing invariants: origin authenticity, replay-safety, finality alignment, parameter binding, and private consumption, which serve as a common vocabulary for reasoning about correctness across modules and chains. The framework covers the Solana Foundation's three pillars (ZK Compression, Confidential Transfer, light clients/bridges) together with surrounding components (Light Protocol/Helius, Succinct SP1, RISC Zero, Wormhole, Tinydancer, Arcium).

Penetrating the Hostile: Detecting DeFi Protocol Exploits through Cross-Contract Analysis,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are crypto projects developed on the blockchain to manage digital assets. Attacks on DeFi have been frequent and have resulted in losses exceeding $80 billion. Current tools detect and locate possible vulnerabilities in contracts by analyzing the state changes that may occur during malicious events. However, this victim-only approaches seldom possess the capability to cover the attacker's interaction intention logic. Furthermore, only a minuscule percentage of DeFi protocols experience attacks in real-world scenarios, which poses a significant challenge for these detection tools to demonstrate practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose DeFiTail, the first framework that utilizes deep learning technology for access control and flash loan exploit detection. Through feeding the cross-contract static data flow, DeFiTail automatically learns the attack logic in real-world malicious events that occur on DeFi protocols, capturing the threat patterns between attacker and victim contracts. Since the DeFi protocol events involve interactions with multi-account transactions, the execution path with external and internal transactions requires to be unified. Moreover, to mitigate the impact of mistakes in Control Flow Graph (CFG) connections, DeFiTail validates the data path by employing the symbolic execution stack. Furthermore, we feed the data paths through our model to achieve the inspection of DeFi protocols. Comparative experiment results indicate that DeFiTail achieves the highest accuracy, with 98.39% in access control and 97.43% in flash loan exploits. DeFiTail also demonstrates an enhanced capability to detect malicious contracts, identifying 86.67% accuracy from the CVE dataset.",2025-11-01 05:23:24+00:00,2025-11-01 05:23:24+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00408v1

Using a structured five-step analytical approach, this article successfully developed and performed a gap analysis that identified 94 network observable techniques from an initial pool of 274 ATT&CK techniques. Sherlock dataset exhibited the highest mean coverage (0.56), followed closely by CIC-IDS2017 (0.55), while SWaT and WADI recorded the lowest scores (0.38). Combining CIC-IDS2017, Sherlock, and CIC-Modbus2023 achieved an aggregate coverage of 92%, highlighting their complementary strengths.

Ultralow-power standoff acoustic leak detection,"An automated, standoff acoustic leak detection scheme has been designed, built, and tested. It merges the principles of glass breakage and smoke detection to alert for the presence of leaks emanating from pressurized plumbing. A simulated water leak flowing at 0.15 l/min has been reliably detected at a standoff distance of more than 10 m. The device is also effective at identifying the presence of leaks located behind surfaces such as walls, doors, floors, and ceilings. The anticipated application is as an autonomous, battery-powered, remote wireless node. All signal processing and analysis takes place on the edge with no need to stream audio data to the cloud. Sensor status is conveyed on-demand with only a few bytes of information, requiring minimal bandwidth. Power consumption is the range of 20--200 micro-Watts, depending on the amount of environmental noise and desired sensor latency. To attain optimum sensitivity and reliability, the hardware operates at acoustic frequencies well above the range of human conversations, making eavesdropping impossible. Development has been done with water escaping from pressurized plumbing, but the sensor concept can be used effectively to detect gas leaks.",2025-11-01 01:23:32+00:00,2025-11-01 01:23:32+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00348v1
Exploiting Latent Space Discontinuities for Building Universal LLM Jailbreaks and Data Extraction Attacks,"The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant concerns about their security against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to crafting universal jailbreaks and data extraction attacks by exploiting latent space discontinuities, an architectural vulnerability related to the sparsity of training data. Unlike previous methods, our technique generalizes across various models and interfaces, proving highly effective in seven state-of-the-art LLMs and one image generation model. Initial results indicate that when these discontinuities are exploited, they can consistently and profoundly compromise model behavior, even in the presence of layered defenses. The findings suggest that this strategy has substantial potential as a systemic attack vector.",2025-11-01 01:19:12+00:00,2025-11-01 01:19:12+00:00,CC-BY 4.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00346v1
